[{"name": "Lamb to the Slaughter", "author": "Roald Dahl", "genre": ["horror", "fiction"], "text": "The room was warm and clean, the curtains drawn, the two table lamps alight-hers and the one by the empty chair opposite. On the sideboard behind her, two tall glasses, soda water, whiskey. Fresh ice cubes in the Thermos bucket.\r\nMary Maloney was waiting for her husband to come home from work.\r\nNow and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about everything she did. The drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new placid look, seemed larger darker than before. When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he came in.\r\n\"Hullo darling,\" she said.\r\n\"Hullo darling,\" he answered.\r\nShe took his coat and hung it in the closet. Then she walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself; and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other, opposite, holding the tall glass with both hands, rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side.\r\nFor her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel-almost as a sunbather feels the sun-that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved intent, far look in his eyes when they rested in her, the funny shape of the mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away.\r\n\"Tired darling?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm tired,\" And as he spoke, he did an unusual thing. He lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of it, at least half of it left.. She wasn't really watching him, but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.\r\n\"I'll get it!\" she cried, jumping up.\r\n\"Sit down,\" he said.\r\nWhen he came back, she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the quantity of whiskey in it.\r\n\"Darling, shall I get your slippers?\"\r\n\"No.\"\r\nShe watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink, and she could see little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong.\r\n\"I think it's a shame,\" she said, \"that when a policeman gets to be as senior as you, they keep him walking about on his feet all day long.\"\r\nHe didn't answer, so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing; but each time he lifted the drink to his lips, she heard the ice cubes clinking against the side of the glass.\r\n\"Darling,\" she said. \"Would you like me to get you some cheese? I haven't made any supper because it's Thursday.\"\r\n\"No,\" he said.\r\n\"If you're too tired to eat out,\" she went on, \"it's still not too late. There's plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer, and you can have it right here and not even move out of the chair.\"\r\nHer eyes waited on him for an answer, a smile, a little nod, but he made no sign.\r\n\"Anyway,\" she went on, \"I'll get you some cheese and crackers first.\"\r\n\"I don't want it,\" he said.\r\nShe moved uneasily in her chair, the large eyes still watching his face. \"But you must eat! I'll fix it anyway, and then you can have it or not, as you like.\"\r\nShe stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp.\r\n\"Sit down,\" he said. \"Just for a minute, sit down.\"\r\nIt wasn't till then that she began to get frightened.\r\n\"Go on,\" he said. \"Sit down.\"\r\nShe lowered herself back slowly into the chair, watching him all the time with those large, bewildered eyes. He had finished the second drink and was staring down into the glass, frowning.\r\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"I've got something to tell you.\"\r\n\"What is it, darling? What's the matter?\"\r\nHe had now become absolutely motionless, and he kept his head down so that the light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face, leaving the chin and mouth in shadow. She noticed there was a little muscle moving near the corner of his left eye.\r\n\"This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,\" he said. \"But I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much.\"\r\nAnd he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she say very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word.\r\n\"So there it is,\" he added. \"And I know it's kind of a bad time to be telling you, bet there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job.\"\r\nHer first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find none of it had ever happened.\r\n\"I'll get the supper,\" she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop her.\r\nWhen she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the floor. She couldn't feel anything at all- except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit. Everything was automatic now-down the steps to the cellar, the light switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so she took off the paper and looked at it again.\r\nA leg of lamb.\r\nAll right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs, holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she stopped.\r\n\"For God's sake,\" he said, hearing her, but not turning round. \"Don't make supper for me. I'm going out.\"\r\nAt that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head.\r\nShe might just as well have hit him with a steel club.\r\nShe stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed to the carpet.\r\nThe violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped bring her out of he shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands.\r\nAll right, she told herself. So I've killed him.\r\nIt was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about murderers with unborn children? Did they kill then both-mother and child? Or did they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?\r\nMary Maloney didn't know. And she certainly wasn't prepared to take a chance.\r\nShe carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven on high, and shoved t inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her hair, touched up her lops and face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.\r\n\"Hullo Sam,\" she said brightly, aloud.\r\nThe voice sounded peculiar too.\r\n\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\"\r\nThat was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went out the back door, down the garden, into the street.\r\nIt wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.\r\n\"Hullo Sam,\" she said brightly, smiling at the man behind the counter.\r\n\"Why, good evening, Mrs. Maloney. How're you?\"\r\n\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\"\r\nThe man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.\r\n\"Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight,\" she told him. \"We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.\"\r\n\"Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?\"\r\n\"No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.\"\r\n\"Oh.\"\r\n\"I don't know much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it this time. You think it'll be all right?\"\r\n\"Personally,\" the grocer said, \"I don't believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?\"\r\n\"Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those.\"\r\n\"Anything else?\" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her pleasantly. \"How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?\"\r\n\"Well-what would you suggest, Sam?\"\r\nThe man glanced around his shop. \"How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.\"\r\n\"Perfect,\" she said. \"He loves it.\"\r\nAnd when it was all wrapped and she had paid, she put on her brightest smile and said, \"Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.\"\r\n\"Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.\"\r\nAnd now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic, or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just going home with the vegetables. Mrs. Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.\r\nThat's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.\r\nTherefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling.\r\n\"Patrick!\" she called. \"How are you, darling?\"\r\nShe put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room; and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.\r\nA few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She know the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him, \"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!\"\r\n\"Who's speaking?\"\r\n\"Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Patrick Maloney.\"\r\n\"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?\"\r\n\"I think so,\" she sobbed. \"He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.\"\r\n\"Be right over,\" the man said.\r\nThe car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policeman walked in. She know them both-she know nearly all the man at that precinct-and she fell right into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley, kneeling by the body.\r\n\"Is he dead?\" she cried.\r\n\"I'm afraid he is. What happened?\"\r\nBriefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.\r\nSoon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two detectives, one of whom she know by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and took pictures, and a man who know about fingerprints. There was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again, this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing, and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how she'd put the meat in the oven-\"it's there now, cooking\"- and how she'd slopped out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.\r\nWhich grocer?\" one of the detectives asked.\r\nShe told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street.\r\nIn fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases-\"...acted quite normal...very cheerful...wanted to give him a good supper...peas...cheesecake...impossible that she...\"\r\nAfter a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policeman. They were exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night.\r\nNo, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment. Would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better. She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.\r\nThen hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.\r\nNo, she said. She'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A little later, perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.\r\nSo they left her there while they went about their business, searching the house. Occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes Jack Noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.\r\n\"It's the old story,\" he said. \"Get the weapon, and you've got the man.\"\r\nLater, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing-a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase.\r\nThey didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.\r\n\"Or a big spanner?\"\r\nShe didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage.\r\nThe search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle. The four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.\r\n\"Jack,\" she said, the next tome Sergeant Noonan went by. \"Would you mind giving me a drink?\"\r\n\"Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whiskey?\"\r\n\"Yes please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better.\"\r\nHe handed her the glass.\r\n\"Why don't you have one yourself,\" she said. \"You must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me.\"\r\n\"Well,\" he answered. \"It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a drop to keep me going.\"\r\nOne by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, come out quickly and said, \"Look, Mrs. Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside.\"\r\n\"Oh dear me!\" she cried. \"So it is!\"\r\n\"I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?\"\r\n\"Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much.\"\r\nWhen the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark tearful eyes. \"Jack Noonan,\" she said.\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\"Would you do me a small favour - you and these others?\"\r\n\"We can try, Mrs. Maloney.\"\r\n\"Well,\" she said. \"Here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick's too, and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terrible hungry by now because it's long past your suppertime, and I know Patrick would never forgive me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering you decent hospitality. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven. It'll be cooked just right by now.\"\r\n\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" Sergeant Noonan said.\r\n\"Please,\" she begged. \"Please eat it. Personally I couldn't tough a thing, certainly not what's been in the house when he was here. But it's all right for you. It'd be a favour to me if you'd eat it up. Then you can go on with your work again afterwards.\"\r\nThere was a good deal of hesitating among the four policemen, but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat.\r\n\"Have some more, Charlie?\"\r\n\"No. Better not finish it.\"\r\n\"She wants us to finish it. She said so. Be doing her a favour.\"\r\n\"Okay then. Give me some more.\"\r\n\"That's the hell of a big club the gut must've used to hit poor Patrick,\" one of them was saying. \"The doc says his skull was smashed all to pieces just like from a sledgehammer.\"\r\n\"That's why it ought to be easy to find.\"\r\n\"Exactly what I say.\"\r\n\"Whoever done it, they're not going to be carrying a thing like that around with them longer than they need.\"\r\nOne of them belched.\r\n\"Personally, I think it's right here on the premises.\"\r\n\"Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?\"\r\nAnd in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle."}, {"name": "The Lottery", "author": "Shirley Jackson", "genre": ["horror", "fiction"], "text": "The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took only about two hours, so it could begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.\r\n\r\nThe children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix\u2014the villagers pronounced this name \"Dellacroy\"\u2014eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.\r\n\r\nSoon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.\r\n\r\nThe lottery was conducted\u2014as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program\u2014by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, \"Little late today, folks.\" The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, \"Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?,\" there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.\r\n\r\nThe original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers' coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves' barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up\u2014of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.\r\n\r\nJust as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. \"Clean forgot what day it was,\" she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. \"Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,\" Mrs. Hutchinson went on, \"and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.\" She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, \"You're in time, though. They're still talking away up there.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, \"Here comes your Mrs., Hutchinson,\" and \"Bill, she made it after all.\" Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, \"Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.\" Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, \"Wouldn't have me leave m'dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?,\" and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson's arrival.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now,\" Mr. Summers said soberly, \"guess we better get started, get this over with, so's we can go back to work. Anybody ain't here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dunbar,\" several people said. \"Dunbar, Dunbar.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Summers consulted his list. \"Clyde Dunbar,\" he said. \"That's right. He's broke his leg, hasn't he? Who's drawing for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, I guess,\" a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. \"Wife draws for her husband,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Don't you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?\" Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.\r\n\r\n\"Horace's not but sixteen yet,\" Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. \"Guess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, \"Watson boy drawing this year?\"\r\n\r\nA tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. \"Here,\" he said. \"I'm drawing for m'mother and me.\" He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like \"Good fellow, Jack,\" and \"Glad to see your mother's got a man to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Mr. Summers said, \"guess that's everyone. Old Man Warner make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" a voice said, and Mr. Summers nodded.\r\n\r\nAsudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. \"All ready?\" he called. \"Now, I'll read the names\u2014heads of families first\u2014and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?\"\r\n\r\nThe people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, \"Adams.\" A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. \"Hi, Steve,\" Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, \"Hi, Joe.\" They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Allen,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Anderson. . . . Bentham.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems like there's no time at all between lotteries any more,\" Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the back row. \"Seems like we got through with the last one only last week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time sure goes fast,\" Mrs. Graves said.\r\n\r\n\"Clark. . . . Delacroix.\"\r\n\r\n\"There goes my old man,\" Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.\r\n\r\n\"Dunbar,\" Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said, \"Go on, Janey,\" and another said, \"There she goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're next,\" Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely, and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands, turning them over and over nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.\r\n\r\n\"Harburt. . . . Hutchinson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get up there, Bill,\" Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Jones.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do say,\" Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, \"that over in the north village they're talking of giving up the lottery.\"\r\n\r\nOld Man Warner snorted. \"Pack of crazy fools,\" he said. \"Listening to the young folks, nothing's good enough for them. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about \u2018Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.' First thing you know, we'd all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There's always been a lottery,\" he added petulantly. \"Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some places have already quit lotteries,\" Mrs. Adams said.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but trouble in that,\" Old Man Warner said stoutly. \"Pack of young fools.\"\r\n\r\n\"Martin.\" And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. \"Overdyke. . . . Percy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish they'd hurry,\" Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. \"I wish they'd hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're almost through,\" her son said.\r\n\r\n\"You get ready to run tell Dad,\" Mrs. Dunbar said.\r\n\r\nMr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box. Then he called, \"Warner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,\" Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. \"Seventy-seventh time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Watson.\" The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, \"Don't be nervous, Jack,\" and Mr. Summers said, \"Take your time, son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zanini.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers, holding his slip of paper in the air, said, \"All right, fellows.\" For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saying, \"Who is it?,\" \"Who's got it?,\" \"Is it the Dunbars?,\" \"Is it the Watsons?\" Then the voices began to say, \"It's Hutchinson. It's Bill,\" \"Bill Hutchinson's got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go tell your father,\" Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.\r\n\r\nPeople began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, \"You didn't give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn't fair!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be a good sport, Tessie,\" Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, \"All of us took the same chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Tessie,\" Bill Hutchinson said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, everyone,\" Mr. Summers said, \"that was done pretty fast, and now we've got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time.\" He consulted his next list. \"Bill,\" he said, \"you draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's Don and Eva,\" Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. \"Make them take their chance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Daughters draw with their husbands' families, Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said gently. \"You know that as well as anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't fair,\" Tessie said.\r\n\r\n\"I guess not, Joe,\" Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. \"My daughter draws with her husband's family, that's only fair. And I've got no other family except the kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it's you,\" Mr. Summers said in explanation, \"and as far as drawing for households is concerned, that's you, too. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Bill Hutchinson said.\r\n\r\n\"How many kids, Bill?\" Mr. Summers asked formally.\r\n\r\n\"Three,\" Bill Hutchinson said. \"There's Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Harry, you got their tickets back?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. \"Put them in the box, then,\" Mr. Summers directed. \"Take Bill's and put it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we ought to start over,\" Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. \"I tell you it wasn't fair. You didn't give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, everybody,\" Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.\r\n\r\n\"Ready, Bill?\" Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" Mr. Summers said, \"take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.\" Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. \"Take a paper out of the box, Davy,\" Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. \"Take just one paper,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Harry, you hold it for him.\" Mr. Graves took the child's hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"Nancy next,\" Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward, switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box. \"Bill, Jr.,\" Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, nearly knocked the box over as he got a paper out. \"Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Bill,\" Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, \"I hope it's not Nancy,\" and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"It's not the way it used to be,\" Old Man Warner said clearly. \"People ain't the way they used to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave's.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill, Jr., opened theirs at the same time, and both beamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.\r\n\r\n\"Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.\r\n\r\n\"It's Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. \"Show us her paper, Bill.\"\r\n\r\nBill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal-company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"All right, folks,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Let's finish quickly.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. \"Come on,\" she said. \"Hurry up.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath. \"I can't run at all. You'll have to go ahead and I'll catch up with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe children had stones already, and someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles.\r\n\r\nTessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. \"It isn't fair,\" she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head.\r\n\r\nOld Man Warner was saying, \"Come on, come on, everyone.\" Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't fair, it isn't right,\" Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her."}, {"name": "Elder Brown's Backslide", "author": "Harry Stillwell Edwards", "genre": ["comedy"], "text": "Elder Brown told his wife good-by at the farmhouse door as mechanically as though his proposed trip to Macon, ten miles away, was an everyday affair, while, as a matter of fact, many years had elapsed since unaccompanied he set foot in the city. He did not kiss her. Many very good men never kiss their wives. But small blame attaches to the elder for his omission on this occasion, since his wife had long ago discouraged all amorous demonstrations on the part of her liege lord, and at this particular moment was filling the parting moments with a rattling list of directions concerning thread, buttons, hooks, needles, and all the many etceteras of an industrious housewife's basket. The elder was laboriously assorting these postscript commissions in his memory, well knowing that to return with any one of them neglected would cause trouble in the family circle.\r\n\r\nElder Brown mounted his patient steed that stood sleepily motionless in the warm sunlight, with his great pointed ears displayed to the right and left, as though their owner had grown tired of the life burden their weight inflicted upon him, and was, old soldier fashion, ready to forego the once rigid alertness of early training for the pleasures of frequent rest on arms.\r\n\r\n\"And, elder, don't you forgit them caliker scraps, or you'll be wantin' kiver soon an' no kiver will be a-comin'.\"\r\n\r\nElder Brown did not turn his head, but merely let the whip hand, which had been checked in its backward motion, fall as he answered mechanically. The beast he bestrode responded with a rapid whisking of its tail and a great show of effort, as it ambled off down the sandy road, the rider's long legs seeming now and then to touch the ground.\r\n\r\nBut as the zigzag panels of the rail fence crept behind him, and he felt the freedom of the morning beginning to act upon his well-trained blood, the mechanical manner of the old man's mind gave place to a mild exuberance. A weight seemed to be lifting from it ounce by ounce as the fence panels, the weedy corners, the persimmon sprouts and sassafras bushes crept away behind him, so that by the time a mile lay between him and the life partner of his joys and sorrows he was in a reasonably contented frame of mind, and still improving.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer figure that crept along the road that cheery May morning. It was tall and gaunt, and had been for thirty years or more. The long head, bald on top, covered behind with iron-gray hair, and in front with a short tangled growth that curled and kinked in every direction, was surmounted by an old-fashioned stove-pipe hat, worn and stained, but eminently impressive. An old-fashioned Henry Clay cloth coat, stained and threadbare, divided itself impartially over the donkey's back and dangled on his sides. This was all that remained of the elder's wedding suit of forty years ago. Only constant care, and use of late years limited to extra occasions, had preserved it so long. The trousers had soon parted company with their friends. The substitutes were red jeans, which, while they did not well match his court costume, were better able to withstand the old man's abuse, for if, in addition to his frequent religious excursions astride his beast, there ever was a man who was fond of sitting down with his feet higher than his head, it was this selfsame Elder Brown.\r\n\r\nThe morning expanded, and the old man expanded with it; for while a vigorous leader in his church, the elder at home was, it must be admitted, an uncomplaining slave. To the intense astonishment of the beast he rode, there came new vigor into the whacks which fell upon his flanks; and the beast allowed astonishment to surprise him into real life and decided motion. Somewhere in the elder's expanding soul a tune had begun to ring. Possibly he took up the far, faint tune that came from the straggling gang of negroes away off in the field, as they slowly chopped amid the threadlike rows of cotton plants which lined the level ground, for the melody he hummed softly and then sang strongly, in the quavering, catchy tones of a good old country churchman, was \"I'm glad salvation's free.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during the singing of this hymn that Elder Brown's regular motion-inspiring strokes were for the first time varied. He began to hold his hickory up at certain pauses in the melody, and beat the changes upon the sides of his astonished steed. The chorus under this arrangement was:\r\n\r\nI'm glad salvation's free,\r\nI'm glad salvation's free,\r\nI'm glad salvation's free for all,\r\nI'm glad salvation's free.\r\nWherever there is an italic, the hickory descended. It fell about as regularly and after the fashion of the stick beating upon the bass drum during a funeral march. But the beast, although convinced that something serious was impending, did not consider a funeral march appropriate for the occasion. He protested, at first, with vigorous whiskings of his tail and a rapid shifting of his ears. Finding these demonstrations unavailing and convinced that some urgent cause for hurry had suddenly invaded the elders serenity, as it had his own, he began to cover the ground with frantic leaps that would have surprised his owner could he have realized what was going on. \r\n\r\nBut Elder Brown's eyes were half closed, and he was singing at the top of his voice. Lost in a trance of divine exaltation, for he felt the effects of the invigorating motion, bent only on making the air ring with the lines which he dimly imagined were drawing upon him the eyes of the whole female congregation, he was supremely unconscious that his beast was hurrying.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the excursion proceeded, until suddenly a shote, surprised in his calm search for roots in a fence corner, darted into the road, and stood for an instant gazing upon the newcomers with that idiotic stare which only a pig can imitate. The sudden appearance of this unlooked-for apparition acted strongly upon the donkey. With one supreme effort he collected himself into a motionless mass of matter, bracing his front legs wide apart; that is to say, he stopped short. There he stood, returning the pig's idiotic stare with an interest which must have led to the presumption that never before in all his varied life had he seen such a singular little creature. End over end went the man of prayer, finally bringing up full length in the sand, striking just as he should have shouted \"free\" for the fourth time in his glorious chorus.\r\n\r\nFully convinced that his alarm had been well founded, the shote sped out from under the gigantic missile hurled at him by the donkey, and scampered down the road, turning first one ear and then the other to detect any sounds of pursuit. The donkey, also convinced that the object before which he had halted was supernatural, started back violently upon seeing it apparently turn to a man. But seeing that it had turned to nothing but a man, he wandered up into the deserted fence corner, and began to nibble refreshment from a scrub oak.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the elder gazed up into the sky, half impressed with the idea that the camp-meeting platform had given way. But the truth forced its way to the front in his disordered understanding at last, and with painful dignity he staggered into an upright position, and regained his beaver. He was shocked again. Never before in all the long years it had served him had he seen it in such shape. The truth is, Elder Brown had never before tried to stand on his head in it. As calmly as possible he began to straighten it out, caring but little for the dust upon his garments. The beaver was his special crown of dignity. To lose it was to be reduced to a level with the common woolhat herd. He did his best, pulling, pressing, and pushing, but the hat did not look natural when he had finished. It seemed to have been laid off into counties, sections, and town lots. Like a well-cut jewel, it had a face for him, view it from whatever point he chose, a quality which so impressed him that a lump gathered in his throat, and his eyes winked vigorously.\r\n\r\nElder Brown was not, however, a man for tears. He was a man of action. The sudden vision which met his wandering gaze, the donkey calmly chewing scrub buds, with the green juice already oozing from the corners of his frothy mouth, acted upon him like magic. He was, after all, only human, and when he got hands upon a piece of brush he thrashed the poor beast until it seemed as though even its already half-tanned hide would be eternally ruined. Thoroughly exhausted at last, he wearily straddled his saddle, and with his chin upon his breast resumed the early morning tenor of his way."}, {"name": "Beware of the Dog", "author": "Roald Dahl", "genre": ["classics"], "text": "Down below there was only a vast white undulating sea of cloud. Above there was the sun, and the sun was white like the clouds, because it is never yellow when one looks at it from high in the air.\r\nHe was still flying the Spitfire. His right hand was on the stick, and he was working the rudder bar with his left leg alone. It was quite easy. The machine was flying well, and he knew what he was doing.\r\nEverything is fine, he thought. I'm doing all right. I'm doing nicely. I know my way home. I'll be there in half an hour. When I land I shall taxi in and switch off my engine and I shall say, help me to get out, will you. I shall make my voice sound ordinary and natural and none of them will take any notice. Then I shall say, someone help me to get out. I can't do it alone because I've lost one of my legs. They'll all laugh and think that I'm joking, and I shall say, all right, come and have a look, you unbelieving bastards. Then Yorky will climb up onto the wing and look inside. He'll probably be sick because of all the blood and the mess. I shall laugh and say, for God's sake, help me out.\r\nHe glanced down again at his right leg. There was not much of it left. The cannon shell had taken him on the thigh, just above the knee, and now there was nothing but a great mess and a lot of blood. But there was no pain. When he looked down, he felt as though he were seeing something that did not belong to him. It had nothing to do with him. It was just a mess which happened to be there in the cockpit; something strange and unusual and rather interesting. It was like finding a dead cat on the sofa.\r\nHe really felt fine, and because he still felt fine, he felt excited and unafraid.\r\nI won't even bother to call up on the radio for the blood wagon, he thought. It isn't necessary. And when I land I'll sit there quite normally and say, some of you fellows come and help me out, will you, because I've lost one of my legs. That will be funny. I'll laugh a little while I'm saying it; I'll say it calmly and slowly, and they'll think I'm joking. When Yorky comes up onto the wing and gets sick, I'll say, Yorky, you old son of a bitch, have you fixed my car yet? Then when I get out I'll make my report and later I'll go up to London. I'll take that half bottle of whisky with me and I'll give it to Bluey. We'll sit in her room and drink it. I'll get the water out of the bathroom tap. I won't say much until it's time to go to bed, then Ill say, Bluey, I've got a surprise for you. I lost a leg today. But I don't mind so long as you don't. It doesn't even hurt.\r\nWe'll go everywhere in cars. I always hated walking, except when I walked down the street of the coppersmiths in Bagdad, but I could go in a rickshaw. I could go home and chop wood, but the head always flies off the ax. Hot water, that's what it needs; put it in the bath and make the handle swell. I chopped lots of wood last time I went home, and I put the ax in the bath. . . .\r\nThen he saw the sun shining on the engine cowling of his machine. He saw the rivets in the metal, and he remembered where he was. He realized that he was no longer feeling good; that he was sick and giddy. His head kept falling forward onto his chest because his neck seemed no longer to have any strength. But he knew that he was flying the Spitfire, and he could feel the handle of the stick between the fingers of his right hand.\r\nI'm going to pass out, he thought. Any moment now I'm going to pass out.\r\nHe looked at his altimeter. Twenty-one thousand. To test himself he tried to read the hundreds as well as the thousands. Twenty-one thousand and what? As he looked the dial became blurred, and he could not even see the needle. He knew then that he must bail out; that there was not a second to lose, otherwise he would become unconscious. Quickly, frantically, he tried to slide back the hood with his left hand, but he had not the strength. For a second he took his right hand off the stick, and with both hands he managed to push the hood back. The rush of cold air on his face seemed to help. He had a moment of great clearness, and his actions became orderly and precise. That is what happens with a good pilot. He took some quick deep breaths from his oxygen mask, and as he did so, he looked out over the side of the cockpit. Down below there was only a vast white sea of cloud, and he realized that he did not know where he was.\r\nIt'll be the Channel, he thought. I'm sure to fall in the drink.\r\nHe throttled back, pulled off his helmet, undid his straps, and pushed the stick hard over to the left. The Spitfire dripped its port wing, and turned smoothly over onto its back. The pilot fell out.\r\nAs he fell he opened his eyes, because he knew that he must not pass out before he had pulled the cord. On one side he saw the sun; on the other he saw the whiteness of the clouds, and as he fell, as he somersaulted in the air, the white clouds chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds. They chased each other in a small circle; they ran faster and faster, and there was the sun and the clouds and the clouds and the sun, and the clouds came nearer until suddenly there was no longer any sun, but only a great whiteness. The whole world was white, and there was nothing in it. It was so white that sometimes it looked black, and after a time it was either white or black, but mostly it was white. He watched it as it turned from white to black, and then back to white again, and the white stayed for a long time, but the black lasted only for a few seconds. He got into the habit of going to sleep during the white periods, and of waking up just in time to see the world when it was black. But the black was very quick. Sometimes it was only a flash, like someone switching off the light, and switching it on again at once, and so whenever it was white, he dozed off.\r\nOne day, when it was white, he put out a hand and he touched something. He took it between his fingers and crumpled it. For a time he lay there, idly letting the tips of his fingers play with the thing which they had touched. Then slowly he opened his eyes, looked down at his hand, and saw that he was holding something which was white. It was the edge of a sheet. He knew it was a sheet because he could see the texture of the material and the stitchings on the hem. He screwed up his eyes, and opened them again quickly. This time he saw the room. He saw the bed in which he was lying; he saw the grey walls and the door and the green curtains over the window. There were some roses on the table by his bed.\r\nThen he saw the basin on the table near the roses. It was a white enamel basin, and beside it there was a small medicine glass.\r\nThis is a hospital, he thought. I am in a hospital. But he could remember nothing. He lay back on his pillow, looking at the ceiling and wondering what had happened. He was gazing at the smooth greyness of the ceiling which was so clean and gray, and then suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it. The sight of this fly, the suddenness of seeing this small black speck on a sea of gray, brushed the surface of his brain, and quickly, in that second, he remembered everything. He remembered the Spitfire and he remembered the altimeter showing twenty-one thousand feet. He remembered the pushing back of the hood with both hands, and he remembered the bailing out. He remembered his leg.\r\nIt seemed all right now. He looked down at the end of the bed, but he could not tell. He put one hand underneath the bedclothes and felt for his knees. He found one of them, but when he felt for the other, his hand touched something which was soft and covered in bandages.\r\nJust then the door opened and a nurse came in.\r\n\"Hello,\" she said. \"So you've waked up at last.\"\r\nShe was not good-looking, but she was large and clean. She was between thirty and forty and she had fair hair. More than that he did not notice.\r\n\"Where am I?\"\r\n\"You're a lucky fellow. You landed in a wood near the beach. You're in Brighton. They brought you in two days ago, and now you're all fixed up. You look fine.\"\r\n\"I've lost a leg,\" he said.\r\n\"That's nothing. We'll get you another one. Now you must go to sleep. The doctor will be coming to see you in about an hour.\" She picked up the basin and the medicine glass and went out.\r\nBut he did not sleep. He wanted to keep his eyes open because he was frightened that if he shut them again everything would go away. He lay looking at the ceiling. The fly was still there. It was very energetic. It would run forward very fast for a few inches, then it would stop. Then it would run forward again, stop, run forward, stop, and every now and then it would take off and buzz around viciously in small circles. It always landed back in the same place on the ceiling and started running and stopping all over again. He watched it for so long that after a while it was no longer a fly, but only a black speck upon a sea of gray, and he was still watching it when the nurse opened the door, and stood aside while the doctor came in. He was an Army doctor, a major, and he had some last war ribbons on his chest. He was bald and small, but he had a cheerful face and kind eyes.\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said. \"So you've decided to wake up at last. How are you feeling?\"\r\n\"I feel all right.\"\r\n\"That's the stuff. You'll be up and about in no time.\"\r\nThe doctor took his wrist to feel his pulse.\r\n\"By the way,\" he said, \"some of the lads from your squadron were ringing up and asking about you. They wanted to come along and see you, but I said that they'd better wait a day or two. Told them you were all right, and that they could come and see you a little later on. Just lie quiet and take it easy for a bit. Got something to read?\" He glanced at the table with the roses. \"No. Well, nurse will look after you. She'll get you anything you want.\" With that he waved his hand and went out, followed by the large clean nurse.\r\nWhen they had gone, he lay back and looked at the ceiling again. The fly was still there and as he lay watching it he heard the noise of an airplane in the distance. He lay listening to the sound of its engines. It was a long way away. I wonder what it is, he thought. Let me see if I can place it. Suddenly he jerked his head sharply to one side. Anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise of a Junkers 88. They can tell most other German bombers for that matter, but especially a Junkers 88. The engines seem to sing a duet. There is a deep vibrating bass voice and with it there is a high pitched tenor. It is the singing of the tenor which makes the sound of a JU-88 something which one cannot mistake.\r\nHe lay listening to the noise, and he felt quite certain about what it was. But where were the sirens, and where the guns? That German pilot certainly had a nerve coming near Brighton alone in daylight.\r\nThe aircraft was always far away, and soon the noise faded away into the distance. Later on there was another. This one, too, was far away, but there was the same deep undulating bass and the high singing tenor, and there was no mistaking it. He had heard that noise every day during the battle.\r\nHe was puzzled. There was a bell on the table by the bed. He reached out his hand and rang it. He heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor, and the nurse came in.\r\n\"Nurse, what were those airplanes?\"\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know. I didn't hear them. Probably fighters or bombers. I expect they were returning from France. Why, what's the matter?\"\r\n\"They were JU-88's. I'm sure they were JU-88's. I know the sound of the engines. There were two of them. What were they doing over here?\"\r\nThe nurse came up to the side of his bed and began to straighten out the sheets and tuck them in under the mattress.\r\n\"Gracious me, what things you imagine. You mustn't worry about a thing like that. Would you like me to get you something to read?\"\r\n\"No, thank you.\"\r\nShe patted his pillow and brushed back the hair from his forehead with her hand.\r\n\"They never come over in daylight any longer. You know that. They were probably Lancasters or Flying Fortresses.\"\r\n\"Nurse.\"\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\"Could I have a cigarette?\"\r\n\"Why certainly you can.\"\r\nShe went out and came back almost at once with a packet of Players and some matches. She handed one to him and when he had put it in his mouth, she struck a match and lit it.\r\n\"If you want me again,\" she said, \"just ring the bell,\" and she went out.\r\nOnce toward evening he heard the noise of another aircraft. It was far away, but even so he knew that it was a single-engined machine. But he could not place it. It was going fast; he could tell that. But it wasn't a Spit, and it wasn't a Hurricane Fighter Air Craft. It did not sound like an American engine either. They make more noise. He did not know what it was, and it worried him greatly. Perhaps I am very ill, he thought. Perhaps I am imagining things. Perhaps I am a little delirious. I simply do not know what to think.\r\nThat evening the nurse came in with a basin of hot water and began to wash him.\r\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I hope you don't still think that we're being bombed.\"\r\nShe had taken off his pajama top and was soaping his right arm with a flannel. He did not answer.\r\nShe rinsed the flannel in the water, rubbed more soap on it, and began to wash his chest.\r\n\"You're looking fine this evening,\" she said. \"They operated on you as soon as you came in. They did a marvelous job. You'll be all right. I've got a brother in the RAF,\" she added. \"Flying bombers.\"\r\nHe said, \"I went to school in Brighton.\"\r\nShe looked up quickly. \"Well, that's fine,\" she said. \"I expect you'll know some people in the town.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I know quite a few.\"\r\nShe had finished washing his chest and arms, and now she turned back the bedclothes, so that his left leg was uncovered. She did it in such a way that his bandaged stump remained under the sheets. She undid the cord of his pajama trousers and took them off. There was no trouble because they had cut off the right trouser leg, so that it could not interfere with the bandages. She began to wash his left leg and the rest of his body. This was the first time he had had a bed bath, and he was embarrassed. She laid a towel under his leg, and she was washing his foot with the flannel. She said, \"This wretched soap won't lather at all. It's the water. It's as hard as nails.\"\r\nHe said, \"None of the soap is very good now and, of course, with hard water it's hopeless.\" As he said it he remembered something. He remembered the baths which he used to take at school in Brighton, in the long stone-floored bathroom which had four baths in a room. He remembered how the water was so soft that you had to take a shower afterwards to get all the soap off your body, and he remembered how the foam used to float on the surface of the water, so that you could not see your legs underneath. He remembered that sometimes they were given calcium tablets because the school doctor used to say that soft water was bad for the teeth.\r\n\"In Brighton,\" he said, \"the water isn't . . .\"\r\nHe did not finish the sentence. Something had occurred to him; something so fantastic and absurd that for a moment he felt like telling the nurse about it and having a good laugh.\r\nShe looked up. \"The water isn't what?\" she said.\r\n\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"I was dreaming.\r\nShe rinsed the flannel in the basin, wiped the soap off his leg, and dried him with a towel.\r\n\"It's nice to be washed,\" he said. \"I feel better.\" He was feeling his face with his hands. \"I need a shave.\"\r\n\"We'll do that tomorrow,\" she said. \"Perhaps you can do it yourself then.\"\r\nThat night he could not sleep. He lay awake thinking of the Junkers 88's and of the hardness of the water. He could think of nothing else. They were JU-88's, he said to himself. I know they were. And yet it is not possible, because they would not be flying around so low over here in broad daylight. I know that it is true, and yet I know that it is impossible. Perhaps I am ill. Perhaps I am behaving like a fool and do not know what I am doing or saying. Perhaps I am delirious. For a long time he lay awake thinking these things, and once he sat up in bed and said aloud, \"I will prove that I am not crazy. I will make a little speech about something complicated and intellectual. I will talk about what to do with Germany after the war.\" But before he had time to begin, he was asleep.\r\nHe woke just as the first light of day was showing through the slit in the curtains over the window. The room was still dark, but he could tell that it was already beginning to get light outside. He lay looking at the grey light which was showing through the slit in the curtain, and as he lay there he remembered the day before. He remembered the Junkers 88's and the hardness of the water; he remembered the large pleasant nurse and the kind doctor, and now the small grain of doubt took root in his mind and it began to grow.\r\nHe looked around the room. The nurse had taken the roses out the night before, and there was nothing except the table with a packet of cigarettes, a box of matches and an ash tray. Otherwise, it was bare. It was no longer warm or friendly. It was not even comfortable. It was cold and empty and very quiet.\r\nSlowly the grain of doubt grew, and with it came fear, a light, dancing fear that warned but did not frighten; the kind of fear that one gets not because one is afraid, but because one feels that there is something wrong. Quickly the doubt and the fear grew so that he became restless and angry, and when he touched his forehead with his hand, he found that it was damp with sweat. He knew then that he must do something; that he must find some way of proving to himself that he was either right or wrong, and he looked up and saw again the window and the green curtains. From where he lay, that window was right in front of him, but it was fully ten yards away. Somehow he must reach it and look out. The idea became an obsession with him, and soon he could think of nothing except the window. But what about his leg? He put his hand underneath the bedclothes and felt the thick bandaged stump which was all that was left on the right-hand side. It seemed all right. It didn't hurt. But it would not be easy.\r\nHe sat up. Then he pushed the bedclothes aside and put his left leg on the floor. Slowly, carefully, he swung his body over until he had both hands on the floor as well; and then he was out of bed, kneeling on the carpet. He looked at the stump. It was very short and thick, covered with bandages. It was beginning to hurt and he could feel it throbbing. He wanted to collapse, lie down on the carpet and do nothing, but he knew that he must go on.\r\nWith two arms and one leg, he crawled over towards the window. He would reach forward as far as he could with his arms, then he would give a little jump and slide his left leg along after them. Each time he did, it jarred his wound so that he gave a soft grunt of pain, but he continued to crawl across the floor on two hands and one knee. When he got to the window he reached up, and one at a time he placed both hands on the sill. Slowly he raised himself up until he was standing on his left leg. Then quickly he pushed aside the curtains and looked out.\r\nHe saw a small house with a gray tiled roof standing alone beside a narrow lane, and immediately behind it there was a plowed field. In front of the house there was an untidy garden, and there was a green hedge separating the garden from the lane. He was looking at the hedge when he saw the sign. It was just a piece of board nailed to the top of a short pole, and because the hedge had not been trimmed for a long time, the branches had grown out around the sign so that it seemed almost as though it had been placed in the middle of the hedge. There was something written on the board with white paint, and he pressed his head against the glass of the window, trying to read what it said. The first letter was a G, he could see that. The second was an A, and the third was an R. One after another he managed to see what the letters were. There were three words, and slowly he spelled the letters out aloud to himself as he managed to read them. G-A-R-D-E A-U C-H-I-E-N. Garde au chien. That is what it said.\r\nHe stood there balancing on one leg and holding tightly to the edges of the window sill with his hands, staring at the sign and at the whitewashed lettering of the words. For a moment he could think of nothing at all. He stood there looking at the sign, repeating the words over and over to himself, and then slowly he began to realize the full meaning of the thing. He looked up at the cottage and at the plowed field. He looked at the small orchard on the left of the cottage and he looked at the green countryside beyond. \"So this is France,\" he said. \"I am France.\"\r\nNow the throbbing in his right thigh was very great. It felt as though someone was pounding the end of his stump with a hammer, and suddenly the pain became so intense that it affected his head and for a moment he thought he was going to fall. Quickly he knelt down again, crawled back to the bed and hoisted himself in. He pulled the bedclothes over himself and lay back on the pillow, exhausted. He could still think of nothing at all except the small sign by the hedge, and the plowed field and the orchard. It was the words on the sign that he could not forget.\r\nIt was some time before the nurse came in. She came carrying a basin of hot water and she said, \"Good morning, how are you today?\"\r\nHe said, \"Good morning, nurse.\"\r\nThe pain was still great under the bandages, but he did not wish to tell this woman anything. He looked at her as she busied herself with getting the washing things ready. He looked at her more carefully now. Her hair was very fair. She was tall and big-boned, and her face seemed pleasant. But there was something a little uneasy about her eyes. They were never still. They never looked at anything for more than a moment and they moved too quickly from one place to another in the room. There was something about her movements also. They were too sharp and nervous to go well with the casual manner in which she spoke.\r\nShe set down the basin, took off his pajama top and began to wash him.\r\n\"Did you sleep well?\"\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\"Good,\" she said. She was washing his arms and his chest.\r\n\"I believe there's someone coming down to see you from the Air Ministry after breakfast,\" she went on. \"They want a report or something. I expect you know all about it. How you got shot down and all that. I won't let him stay long, so don't worry.\"\r\nHe did not answer. She finished washing him, and gave him a toothbrush and some tooth powder. He brushed his teeth, rinsed his mouth and spat the water out into the basin.\r\nLater she brought him his breakfast on a tray, but he did not want to eat. He was still feeling weak and sick, and he wished only to lie still and think about what had happened. And there was a sentence running through his head. It was a sentence which Johnny, the Intelligence Officer of his squadron, always repeated to the pilots every day before they went out. He could see Johnny now, leaning against the wall of the dispersal hut with his pipe in his hand, saying, \"And if they get you, don't forget, just your name, rank and number. Nothing else. For God's sake, say nothing else.\"\r\n\"There you are,\" she said as she put the tray on his lap. \"I've got you an egg. Can you manage all right?\"\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\nShe stood beside the bed. \"Are you feeling all right?\"\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\"Good. If you want another egg I might be able to get you one.\"\r\n\"This is all right.\"\r\n\"Well, just ring the bell if you want any more.\" And she went out.\r\nHe had just finished eating, when the nurse came in again.\r\nShe said, \"Wing Commander Roberts is here. I've told him that he can only stay for a few minutes.\"\r\nShe beckoned with her hand and the Wing Commander came in.\r\n\"Sorry to bother you like this,\" he said.\r\nHe was an ordinary RAF officer, dressed in a uniform which was a little shabby, and he wore wings and a DFC. He was fairly tall and thin with plenty of black hair. His teeth, which were irregular and widely spaced, stuck out a little even when he closed his mouth. As he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil from his pocket, and he pulled up a chair and sat down.\r\n\"How are you feeling?\"\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\"Tough luck about your leg. I know how you feel. I hear you put up a fine show before they got you.\"\r\nThe man in the bed was lying quite still, watching the man in the chair.\r\nThe man in the chair said, \"Well, let's get this stuff over. I'm afraid you'll have to answer a few questions so that I can fill in this combat report. Let me see now, first of all, what was your squadron?\"\r\nThe man in the bed did not move. He looked straight at the Wing Commander and he said, \"My name is Peter Williamson. My rank is Squadron Leader and my number is nine seven two four five seven.\""}, {"name": "Man from the South", "author": "Roald Dahl", "genre": ["classics"], "text": "It was getting on toward six o'clock so I thought I'd buy myself a beer and go out and sit in a deck chair by the swimming pool and have a little evening sun.\r\nI went to the bar and got the beer and carried it outside and wandered down the garden toward the pool.\r\nIt was a fine garden with lawns and beds of azaleas and tall coconut palms, and the wind was blowing strongly through the tops of the palm trees making the leaves hiss and crackle as though they were on fire. I could see the clusters of big brown nuts handing down underneath the leaves.\r\nThere were plenty of deck chairs around the swimming pool and there were white tables and huge brightly colored umbrellas and sunburned men and women sitting around in bathing suits. In the pool itself there were three or four girls and about a dozen boys, all splashing about and making a lot of noise and throwing a large rubber ball at one another.\r\nI stood watching them. The girls were English girls from the hotel. The boys I didn't know about, but they sounded American and I thought they were probably naval cadets who'd come ashore from the U.S. naval training vessel which had arrived in the harbor that morning.\r\nI went over and sat down under a yellow umbrella where there were four empty seats, and I poured my beer and settled back comfortably with a cigarette.\r\nIt was very pleasant sitting there in the sunshine with beer and a cigarette. It was pleasant to sit and watch the bathers splashing about in the green water.\r\nThe American sailors were getting on nicely with the English girls. They'd reached the stage where they were diving under the water and tipping them up by their legs.\r\nJust then I noticed a small, oldish man walking briskly around the edge of the pool. He was immaculately dressed in a white suit and he walked very quickly with little bouncing strides, pushing himself high up onto his toes with each step. He had on a large creamy Panama hat, and he came bouncing along the side of the pool, looking at the people and the chairs.\r\nHe stopped beside me and smiled, showing two rows of very small, uneven teeth, slightly tarnished. I smiled back.\r\n\"Excuse pleess, but may I sit here?\"\r\n\"Certainly,\" I said. \"Go ahead.\"\r\nHe bobbed around to the back of the chair and inspected it for safety, then he sat down and crossed his legs. His white buckskin shows had little holes punched all over them for ventilation.\r\n\"A fine evening,\" he said. \"They are all evenings fine here in Jamaica.\" I couldn't tell if the accent were Italian or Spanish, but I felt fairly sure he was some sort of a South American. And old too, when you saw him close. Probably around sixty-eight or seventy.\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"It is wonderful here, isn't it.\"\r\n\"And who, might I ask are all dese? Dese is no hotel people.\" He was pointing at the bathers in the pool.\r\n\"I think they're American sailors,\" I told him. \"They're Americans who are learning to be sailors.\"\r\n\"Of course dey are Americans. Who else in de world is going to make as much noise as dat? You are not American, no?\"\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"I am not.\"\r\nSuddenly one of the American cadets was standing in front of us. He was dripping wet from the pool and one of the English girls was standing there with him.\r\n\"Are these chairs taken?\" he said.\r\n\"No,\" I answered.\r\n\"Mind if I sit down?\"\r\n\"Go ahead.\"\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said. He had a towel in his hand and when he sat down he unrolled it and produced a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He offered the cigarettes to the girl and she refused; then he offered them to me and I took one. The little man said, \"Tank you, no, but I tink I have a cigar.\" He pulled out a crocodile case and got himself a cigar, then he produced a knife which had a small scissors in it and he snipped the end off the cigar.\r\n\"Here, let me give you a light.\" The American boy held up his lighter.\r\n\"Dat will not work in dis wind.\"\r\n\"Sure, it'll work. It always works.\"\r\nThe little man removed his unlighted cigar from his mouth, cocked his head on one side and looked at the boy.\r\n\"All-ways?\" he said softly.\r\n\"Sure, it never fails. Not with me anyway.\"\r\nThe little man's head was still cocked over on one side and he was still watching the boy. \"Well, well. So you say dis famous lighter it never fails. Iss dat you say?\"\r\n\"Sure,\" the boy said. \"That's right.\" He was about nineteen or twenty with a long freckled face and a rather sharp birdlike nose. His chest was not very sunburned and there were freckles there too, and a few wisps of pale-reddish hair. He was holding the lighter in his right hand, ready to flip the wheel. \"It never fails,\" he said, smiling now because he was purposely exaggerating his little boast. \"I promise you it never fails.\"\r\n\"One momint, pleess.\" The hand that held the cigar came up high, palm outward, as though it were stopping traffic. \"Now juss one momint.\" He had a curiously soft, toneless voice and he kept looking at the boy all the time.\r\n\"Shall we not perhaps make a little bet on dat?\" He smiled at the boy. \"Shall we not make a little bet on whether your lighter lights?\"\r\n\"Sure, I'll bet,\" the boy said. \"Why not?\"\r\n\"You like to bet?\"\r\n\"Sure, I'll always bet.\"\r\nThe man paused and examined his cigar, and I must say I didn't much like the way he was behaving. It seemed he was already trying to make something out of this, and to embarrass the boy, and at the same time I had the feeling he was relishing a private little secret all his own.\r\nHe looked up again at the boy and said slowly, \"I like to bet, too. Why we don't have a good bet on dis ting? A good big bet?\r\n\"Now wait a minute,\" the boy said. \"I can't do that. But I'll bet you a dollar, or whatever it is over here-some shillings, I guess.\"\r\nThe little man waved his hand again. \"Listen to me. Now we have some fun. We make a bet. Den we go up to my room here in de hotel where iss no wind and I bet you you cannot light dis famous lighter of yours ten times running without missing once.\"\r\n\"I'll bet I can,\" the boy said.\r\n\"All right. Good. We make a bet, yes?\"\r\n\"Sure. I'll bet you a buck.\"\r\n\"No, no. I make you very good bet. I am rich man and I am sporting man also. Listen to me. Outside de hotel iss my car. Iss very fine car. American car from your country. Cadillac-\"\r\n\"Hey, now. Wait a minute.\" The boy leaned back in his deck chair and he laughed. \"I can't put up that sort of property. This is crazy.\"\r\n\"Not crazy at all. You strike lighter successfully ten times running and Cadillac is yours. You like to have dis Cadillac, yes?\"\r\n\"Sure, I'd like to have a Cadillac.\" The boy was still grinning.\r\n\"All right. Fine. We make a bet and I put up my Cadillac.\"\r\n\"And what do I put up?\"\r\n\"The little man carefully removed the red band from his still unlighted cigar. \"I never ask you, my friend, to bet something you cannot afford. You understand?\"\r\n\"Then what do I bet?\"\r\n\"I make it very easy for you, yes?\"\r\n\"Okay. You make it easy.\"\r\n\"Some small ting you can afford to give away, and if you did happen to lose it you would not feel too bad. Right?\"\r\n\"Such as what?\"\r\n\"Such as, perhaps, de little finger of your left hand.\"\r\n\"My what! The boy stopped grinning.\r\n\"Yes. Why not? You win, you take de car. You looss, I take de finger.\"\r\n\"I don't get it. How d'you mean, you take the finger?\"\r\n\"I chop it off.\"\r\n\"Jumping jeepers! That's a crazy bet. I think I'll just make it a dollar.\"\r\nThe man leaned back, spread out his hands palms upward and gave a tiny contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. \"Well, well, well,\" he said. \"I do not understand. You say it lights but you will not bet. Den we forget it, yes?\"\r\nThe boy sat quite still, staring at the bathers in the pool. Then he remembered suddenly he hadn't lighted his cigarette. He put it between his lips, cupped his hands around the lighter and flipped the wheel. The wick lighted and burned with a small, steady, yellow flame and the way he held his hands the wind didn't get to it at all.\r\n\"Could I have a light, too?\" I said.\r\n\"Gee, I'm sorry. I forgot you didn't have one.\"\r\nI held out my hand for the lighter, but he stood up and came over to do it for me.\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said, and he returned to his seat.\r\n\"You having a good time?\" I asked.\r\n\"Fine,\" he answered. \"It's pretty nice here.\"\r\nThere was a silence then, and I could see that the little man has succeeded in disturbing the boy with his absurd proposal. He was sitting there very still, and it was obvious that a small tension was beginning to build up inside him. Then he started shifting about in his seat, and rubbing his chest, and stroking the back of his neck, and finally he placed both hands on his knees and began tapping his fingers against his knee-caps. Soon he was tapping with one of his feet as well.\r\n\"Now just let me check up on this bet of yours,\" he said at last. \"You say we go up to your room and if I make this lighter light ten times running I win a Cadillac. If it misses just once then I forfeit the little finger of my left hand. Is that right?\"\r\n\"Certainly. Dat is de bet. But I tink you are afraid.\"\r\n\"What do we do if I lose? Do I have to hold my finger out while you chop it off?\"\r\n\"Oh, no! Dat would be no good. And you might be tempted to refuse to hold it out. What I should do I should tie one of your hands to de table before we started and I should stand dere with a knife ready to go chop de momint your lighter missed.\"\r\n\"What year is the Cadillac?\" the boy asked.\r\n\"Excuse. I not understand.\"\r\n\"What year-how old is the Cadillac?\"\r\n\"Ah! How old? Yes. It is last year. Quite now car. But I see you are not betting man. Americans never are.\"\r\nThe boy paused for just a moment and he glanced first at the English girl, then at me. \"Yes,\" he said sharply. \"I'll bet you.\"\r\n\"Good!\" The little man clapped his hands together quietly, once. \"Fine,\" he said. \"We do it now. And you, sir,\" he turned to me, \"you would perhaps be good enough to, what you call it, to-to referee.\" He had pale, almost colorless eyes with tiny bright black pupils.\r\n\"Well,\" I said. \"I think it's a crazy bet. I don't think I like it very much.\"\r\n\"Nor do I,\" said the English girl. It was the first time she'd spoken. \"I think it's a stupid, ridiculous bet.\"\r\n\"Are you serious about cutting off this boy's finger if he loses?\" I said.\r\n\"Certainly I am. Also about cutting off this boy's finger if he loses?\" I said.\r\n\"Certainly I am. Also about giving him Cadillac if he win. Come now. We go to my room.\"\r\nHe stood up. \"You like to put on some clothes first?\" he said.\r\n\"No,\" the boy answered. \"I'll come like this.\" Then he turned to me. \"I'd consider it a favor if you'd come along and referee.\"\r\n\"All right,\" I said. \"I'll come along, but I don't like the bet.\"\r\n\"You come too,\" he said to the girl. \"You come and watch.\r\nThe little man led the way back through the garden to the hotel. He was animated now, and excited, and that seemed to make him bounce up higher than ever on his toes as he walked along.\r\n\"I live in annex,\" he said. \"You like to see car first? Iss just here.\"\r\nHe took us to where we could see the front driveway of the hotel and he stopped and pointed to a sleek pale-green Cadillac parked close by.\r\n\"Dere she iss. De green one. You like?\"\r\n\"Say, that's a nice car,\" the boy said.\r\n\"All right. Now we go up and see if you can win her.\"\r\nWe followed him into the annex and up one flight of stairs. He unlocked his door and we all trooped into what was a large pleasant double bedroom. There was a woman's dressing gown lying across the bottom of one of the beds.\r\n\"First,\" he said, \"we'ave a little Martini.\"\r\nThe drinks were on a small table in the far corner, all ready to be mixed, and there was a shaker and ice and plenty of glasses. He began to make the Martini, but meanwhile he'd rung the bell and now there was a knock on the door and a colored maid came in.\r\n\"Ah!\" he said, putting down the bottle of gin, taking a wallet from his pocket and pulling out a pound note. \"You will do something for me now, pleess.\" He gave the maid the pound.\r\n\"You keep dat,\" he said. \"And now we are going to play a little game in here and I want you to go off and find for me two-no three tings. I want some nails; I want a hammer, and I want a chopping knife, a butcher's chipping knife which you can borrow from de kitchen. You can get, yes?\"\r\n\"A chopping knife!\" The maid opened her eyes wide and clasped her hands in front of her. \"You mean a real chopping knife?\"\r\n\"Yes, yes, of course. Come on now, pleess. You can find dose tings surely for me.\"\r\n\"Yes, sir, I'll try, sir. Surely I'll try to get them.\" And she went.\r\nThe little man handed round the Martinis. We stood there and sipped them, the boy with the long freckled face and the pointed nose, bare-bodied except for a pair of faded brown bathing shorts; the English girl, a large-boned, fair-haired girl wearing a pale blue bathing suit, who watched the boy over the top of her glass all the time; the little man with the colorless eyes standing there in his immaculate white suit drinking his Martini and looking at the girl in her pale blue bathing dress. I didn't know what to make of it all. The man seemed serious about the bet and he seemed serious about the business of cutting off the finger. But hell, what if the boy lost? Then we'd have to rush him to the hospital in the Cadillac that he hadn't won. That would be a fine thing. Now wouldn't that be a really find thing? It would be a damn silly unnecessary thing so far as I could see.\r\n\"Don't you think this is rather a silly bet?\" I said.\r\n\"I think it's a fine bet,\" the boy answered. He had already downed one large Martini.\r\n\"I think it's a stupid, ridiculous bet,\" the girl said. \"What'll happen if you lose?\"\r\n\"It won't matter. Come to think of it, I can't remember ever in my life having had any use for the little finger on my left hand. Here he is.\" The boy took hold of the finger. \"Here he is and he hasn't ever done a thing for me yet. So why shouldn't I bet him. I think it's a fine bet.\"\r\nThe little man smiled and picked up the shaker and refilled our glasses.\r\n\"Before we begin,\" he said, \"I will present to de-to de referee de key of de car.\" He produced a car key from his pocket and gave it to me. \"De papers,\" he said, \"de owning papers and insurance are in de pocket of de car.\"\r\nThen the colored maid came in again. In one hand she carried a small chopper, the kind used by butchers for chopping meat bones, and in the other a hammer and a bag of nails.\r\n\"Good! You get dem all. Tank you, tank you. Now you can go.\" He waited until the maid had closed the door, then he put the implements on one of the beds and said, \"Now we prepare ourselves, yes?\" And to the boy \"Help me, pleess, with dis table. We carry it out a little.\"\r\nIt was the usual kind of hotel writing desk, just a plain rectangular table about four feet by three with a blotting pad, ink, pens and paper. They carried it out into the room away from the wall, and removed the writing things.\r\n\"And now,\" he said, \"a chair.\" He picked up a chair and placed it beside the table. He was very brisk and very animated, like a person organizing games at a children's party. \"And now de nails. I must put in de nails.\" He fetched the nails and he began to hammer them into the top of the table.\r\nWe stood there, the boy, the girl, and I, holding Martinis in out hands, watching the little man at work. We watched him hammer two nails into the table, about six inches apart. He didn't hammer them right home; he allowed a small part of each one to stick up. Then he tested them for firmness with his fingers.\r\nAnyone would think the son of a bitch had done this before, I told myself. He never hesitates. Table, nails, hammer, kitchen chopper. He knows exactly what he needs and how to arrange it.\r\n\"And now,\" he said, \"all we want is some string.\" He found some string. \"All right, at last we are ready. Will you pleess to sit here at de table,\" he said to the boy.\r\nThe boy put his glass away and sat down.\r\n\"Now place de left hand between dese two nails. De nails are only so I can tie your hand in place. All right, good. Now I tie your hand secure to de table-so,\"\r\nHe wound the string around the boy's wrist, then several times around the wide part of the hand, then he fastened it tight to the nails. He made a good job of it and when he'd finished there wasn't any question about the boy being able to draw his hand away. But he could move his fingers.\r\n\"Now pleess, clench de fist, all except for de little finger. You must leave de little finger sticking out, lying on de table.\"\r\n\"Ex-cellent! Ex-cellent! Now we are ready. Wid your right hand you manipulate de lighter. But one momint, pleess.\"\r\nHe skipped over to the bed and picked up the chopper. He came back and stood beside the table with the chopper in his hand.\r\n\"We are all ready?\" he said. \"Mister referee, you must say to begin.\"\r\nThe English girl was standing there in her pale blue bathing costume right behind the boy's chair. She was just standing there, not saying anything. The boy was sitting quite still, holding the lighter in his right hand, looking at the chopper. The little man was looking at me.\r\n\"Are you ready?\" I asked the boy.\r\n\"I'm ready.\"\r\n\"And you?\" to the little man.\r\n\"Quite ready,\" he said and he lifted the chopper up in the air and held it there about two feet above the boy's finger, ready to chop. The boy watched it, but he didn't flinch and his mouth didn't move at all. He merely raised his eyebrows and frowned.\r\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Go ahead.\"\r\nThe boy said, \"Will you please count aloud the number of times I light it.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I'll do that.\"\r\nWith his thumb he raised the top of the lighter, and again with the thumb he gave the wheel a sharp flick. The flint sparked and the wick caught fire and burned with a small yellow flame.\r\n\"One!\" I called.\r\nHe didn't blow the flame out; he closed the top of the lighter on it and he waited for perhaps five seconds before opening it again.\r\nHe flicked the wheel very strongly and once more there was a small flame burning on the wick.\r\n\"Two!\"\r\nNo one else said anything. The boy kept his eyes on the lighter. The little man held the chipper up in the air and he too was watching the lighter.\r\n\"Three!\"\r\n\"Four!\"\r\n\"Five!\"\r\n\"Six!\"\r\n\"Seven!\" Obviously it was one of those lighters that worked. The fling gave a big spark and the wick was the right length. I watched the thumb snapping the top down onto the flame. Then a pause. Then the thumb raising the top once more. This was an all-thumb operation. The thumb did everything. I took a breath, ready to say eight. The thumb flicked the wheel. The flint sparked. The little flame appeared.\r\n\"Eight!\" I said, and as I said it the door opened. We all turned and we saw a woman standing in the doorway, a small, black-haired woman, rather old, who stood there for about two seconds then rushed forward shouting, \"Carlos! Carlos!\" She grabbed his wrist, took the chopper from him, threw it on the bed, took hold of the little man by the lapels of his white suit and began shaking him very vigorously, talking to him fast and loud and fiercely all the time in some Spanish-sounding language. She shook him so fast you couldn't see him any more. He became a faint, misty, quickly moving outline, like the spokes of a turning wheel.\r\nThen she slowed down and the little man came into view again and she hauled him across the room and pushed him backward onto one of the beds. He sat on the edge of it blinking his eyes and testing his head to see if it would still turn on his neck.\r\n\"I am so sorry,\" the woman said. \"I am so terribly sorry that this should happen.\" She spoke almost perfect English.\r\n\"It is too bad,\" she went on. \"I suppose it is really my fault. For ten minutes I leave him alone to go and have my hair washed and I come back and he is at it again.\" She looked sorry and deeply concerned.\r\nThe boy was untying his hand from the table. The English girl and I stood there and said nothing.\r\n\"He is a menace,\" the woman said. \"Down where we live at home he has taken altogether forty-seven fingers from different people, and he has lost eleven cars. In the end they threatened to have him put away somewhere. That's why I brought him up here.\"\r\n\"We were only having a little bet,\" mumbled the little man from the bed.\r\n\"I suppose he bet you a car,\" the woman said.\r\n\"Yes,\" the boy answered. \"A Cadillac.\"\r\n\"He has no car. It's mine. And that makes it worse,\" she said, \"that he should bet you when he has nothing to bet with. I am ashamed and very sorry about it all.\" She seemed an awfully nice woman.\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"then here's the key of your car.\" I put it on the table.\r\n\"We were only having a little bet,\" mumbled the little man.\r\n\"He hasn't anything left to bet with,\" the woman said. \"He hasn't a thing in the world. Not a thing. As a matter of fact I myself won it all from him a long while ago. It took time, a lot of time, and it was hard work, but I won it all in the end.\" She looked up at the boy and she smiled, a slow sad smile, and she came over and put out a hand to take the key from the table.\r\nI can see it now, that hand of hers; it had only one finger on it, and a thumb."}, {"name": "Shooting an Elephant", "author": "George Orwell", "genre": ["classics"], "text": "In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people--the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me. I was sub-divisional police officer of the town, and in an aimless, petty kind of way anti-European feeling was very bitter. No one had the guts to raise a riot, but if a European woman went through the bazaar alone somebody would probably spit betel juice over her dress. As a police officer I was an obvious target and was baited whenever it seemed safe to do so. When a nimble Burman tripped me up on the football field and the referee another Burman looked the other way, the crowd yelled with hideous laughter. This happened more than once. In the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere, the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves. The young Buddhist priests were the worst of all. There were several thousands of them in the town and none of them seemed to have anything to do except stand on street corners and jeer at Europeans.\r\nAll this was perplexing and upsetting. For at that time I had already made up my mind that imperialism was an evil thing and the sooner I chucked up my job and got out of it the better. Theoretically--and secretly, of course--I was all for the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British. As for the job I was doing, I hated it more bitterly than I can perhaps make clear. In a job like that you see the dirty work of Empire at close quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling in the stinking cages of the lock-ups, the grey, cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the scarred buttocks of the men who had been Bogged with bamboos--all these oppressed me with an intolerable sense of guilt. But I could get nothing into perspective. I was young and ill-educated and I had had to think out my problems in the utter silence that is imposed on every Englishman in the East. I did not even know that the British Empire is dying, still less did I know that it is a great deal better than the younger empires that are going to supplant it. All I knew was that I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make my job impossible. With one part of my mind I thought of the British Raj as an unbreakable tyranny, as something clamped down, in saecula saeculorum, upon the will of prostrate peoples; with another part I thought that the greatest joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a Buddhist priest's guts. Feelings like these are the normal by-products of imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him off duty.\r\nOne day something happened which in a roundabout way was enlightening. It was a tiny incident in itself, but it gave me a better glimpse than I had had before of the real nature of imperialism--the real motives for which despotic governments act. Early one morning the sub-inspector at a police station the other end of the town rang me up on the phone and said that an elephant was ravaging the bazaar. Would I please come and do something about it? I did not know what I could do, but I wanted to see what was happening and I got on to a pony and started out. I took my rifle, an old .44 Winchester and much too small to kill an elephant, but I thought the noise might be useful in terrorem. Various Burmans stopped me on the way and told me about the elephant's doings. It was not, of course, a wild elephant, but a tame one which had gone \"must.\" It had been chained up, as tame elephants always are when their attack of \"must\" is due, but on the previous night it had broken its chain and escaped. Its mahout, the only person who could manage it when it was in that state, had set out in pursuit, but had taken the wrong direction and was now twelve hours' journey away, and in the morning the elephant had suddenly reappeared in the town. The Burmese population had no weapons and were quite helpless against it. It had already destroyed somebody's bamboo hut, killed a cow and raided some fruit-stalls and devoured the stock; also it had met the municipal rubbish van and, when the driver jumped out and took to his heels, had turned the van over and inflicted violences upon it.\r\nThe Burmese sub-inspector and some Indian constables were waiting for me in the quarter where the elephant had been seen. It was a very poor quarter, a labyrinth of squalid bamboo huts, thatched with palmleaf, winding all over a steep hillside. I remember that it was a cloudy, stuffy morning at the beginning of the rains. We began questioning the people as to where the elephant had gone and, as usual, failed to get any definite information. That is invariably the case in the East; a story always sounds clear enough at a distance, but the nearer you get to the scene of events the vaguer it becomes. Some of the people said that the elephant had gone in one direction, some said that he had gone in another, some professed not even to have heard of any elephant. I had almost made up my mind that the whole story was a pack of lies, when we heard yells a little distance away. There was a loud, scandalized cry of \"Go away, child! Go away this instant!\" and an old woman with a switch in her hand came round the corner of a hut, violently shooing away a crowd of naked children. Some more women followed, clicking their tongues and exclaiming; evidently there was something that the children ought not to have seen. I rounded the hut and saw a man's dead body sprawling in the mud. He was an Indian, a black Dravidian coolie, almost naked, and he could not have been dead many minutes. The people said that the elephant had come suddenly upon him round the corner of the hut, caught him with its trunk, put its foot on his back and ground him into the earth. This was the rainy season and the ground was soft, and his face had scored a trench a foot deep and a couple of yards long. He was lying on his belly with arms crucified and head sharply twisted to one side. His face was coated with mud, the eyes wide open, the teeth bared and grinning with an expression of unendurable agony. Never tell me, by the way, that the dead look peaceful. Most of the corpses I have seen looked devilish. The friction of the great beast's foot had stripped the skin from his back as neatly as one skins a rabbit. As soon as I saw the dead man I sent an orderly to a friend's house nearby to borrow an elephant rifle. I had already sent back the pony, not wanting it to go mad with fright and throw me if it smelt the elephant.\r\nThe orderly came back in a few minutes with a rifle and five cartridges, and meanwhile some Burmans had arrived and told us that the elephant was in the paddy fields below, only a few hundred yards away. As I started forward practically the whole population of the quarter flocked out of the houses and followed me. They had seen the rifle and were all shouting excitedly that I was going to shoot the elephant. They had not shown much interest in the elephant when he was merely ravaging their homes, but it was different now that he was going to be shot. It was a bit of fun to them, as it would be to an English crowd; besides they wanted the meat. It made me vaguely uneasy. I had no intention of shooting the elephant--I had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself if necessary--and it is always unnerving to have a crowd following you. I marched down the hill, looking and feeling a fool, with the rifle over my shoulder and an ever-growing army of people jostling at my heels. At the bottom, when you got away from the huts, there was a metalled road and beyond that a miry waste of paddy fields a thousand yards across, not yet ploughed but soggy from the first rains and dotted with coarse grass. The elephant was standing eight yards from the road, his left side towards us. He took not the slightest notice of the crowd's approach. He was tearing up bunches of grass, beating them against his knees to clean them and stuffing them into his mouth.\r\nI had halted on the road. As soon as I saw the elephant I knew with perfect certainty that I ought not to shoot him. It is a serious matter to shoot a working elephant--it is comparable to destroying a huge and costly piece of machinery--and obviously one ought not to do it if it can possibly be avoided. And at that distance, peacefully eating, the elephant looked no more dangerous than a cow. I thought then and I think now that his attack of \"must\" was already passing off; in which case he would merely wander harmlessly about until the mahout came back and caught him. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. I decided that I would watch him for a little while to make sure that he did not turn savage again, and then go home.\r\nBut at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. It blocked the road for a long distance on either side. I looked at the sea of yellow faces above the garish clothes-faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a trick. They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward, irresistibly. And it was at this moment, as I stood there with the rifle in my hands, that I first grasped the hollowness, the futility of the white man's dominion in the East. Here was I, the white man with his gun, standing in front of the unarmed native crowd--seemingly the leading actor of the piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys. He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the conventionalized figure of a sahib. For it is the condition of his rule that he shall spend his life in trying to impress the \"natives,\" and so in every crisis he has got to do what the \"natives\" expect of him. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it. I had got to shoot the elephant. I had committed myself to doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got to act like a sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind and do definite things. To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly away, having done nothing--no, that was impossible. The crowd would laugh at me. And my whole life, every white man's life in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.\r\nBut I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his bunch of grass against his knees, with that preoccupied grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. At that age I was not squeamish about killing animals, but I had never shot an elephant and never wanted to. Somehow it always seems worse to kill a large animal. Besides, there was the beast's owner to be considered. Alive, the elephant was worth at least a hundred pounds; dead, he would only be worth the value of his tusks, five pounds, possibly. But I had got to act quickly. I turned to some experienced-looking Burmans who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephant had been behaving. They all said the same thing: he took no notice of you if you left him alone, but he might charge if you went too close to him.\r\nIt was perfectly clear to me what I ought to do. I ought to walk up to within, say, twenty-five yards of the elephant and test his behavior. If he charged, I could shoot; if he took no notice of me, it would be safe to leave him until the mahout came back. But also I knew that I was going to do no such thing. I was a poor shot with a rifle and the ground was soft mud into which one would sink at every step. If the elephant charged and I missed him, I should have about as much chance as a toad under a steam-roller. But even then I was not thinking particularly of my own skin, only of the watchful yellow faces behind. For at that moment, with the crowd watching me, I was not afraid in the ordinary sense, as I would have been if I had been alone. A white man mustn't be frightened in front of \"natives\"; and so, in general, he isn't frightened. The sole thought in my mind was that if anything went wrong those two thousand Burmans would see me pursued, caught, trampled on and reduced to a grinning corpse like that Indian up the hill. And if that happened it was quite probable that some of them would laugh. That would never do.\r\nThere was only one alternative. I shoved the cartridges into the magazine and lay down on the road to get a better aim. The crowd grew very still, and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see the theatre curtain go up at last, breathed from innumerable throats. They were going to have their bit of fun after all. The rifle was a beautiful German thing with cross-hair sights. I did not then know that in shooting an elephant one would shoot to cut an imaginary bar running from ear-hole to ear-hole. I ought, therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight at his ear-hole, actually I aimed several inches in front of this, thinking the brain would be further forward.\r\nWhen I pulled the trigger I did not hear the bang or feel the kick--one never does when a shot goes home--but I heard the devilish roar of glee that went up from the crowd. In that instant, in too short a time, one would have thought, even for the bullet to get there, a mysterious, terrible change had come over the elephant. He neither stirred nor fell, but every line of his body had altered. He looked suddenly stricken, shrunken, immensely old, as though the frighfful impact of the bullet had paralysed him without knocking him down. At last, after what seemed a long time--it might have been five seconds, I dare say--he sagged flabbily to his knees. His mouth slobbered. An enormous senility seemed to have settled upon him. One could have imagined him thousands of years old. I fired again into the same spot. At the second shot he did not collapse but climbed with desperate slowness to his feet and stood weakly upright, with legs sagging and head drooping. I fired a third time. That was the shot that did for him. You could see the agony of it jolt his whole body and knock the last remnant of strength from his legs. But in falling he seemed for a moment to rise, for as his hind legs collapsed beneath him he seemed to tower upward like a huge rock toppling, his trunk reaching skyward like a tree. He trumpeted, for the first and only time. And then down he came, his belly towards me, with a crash that seemed to shake the ground even where I lay.\r\nI got up. The Burmans were already racing past me across the mud. It was obvious that the elephant would never rise again, but he was not dead. He was breathing very rhythmically with long rattling gasps, his great mound of a side painfully rising and falling. His mouth was wide open--I could see far down into caverns of pale pink throat. I waited a long time for him to die, but his breathing did not weaken. Finally I fired my two remaining shots into the spot where I thought his heart must be. The thick blood welled out of him like red velvet, but still he did not die. His body did not even jerk when the shots hit him, the tortured breathing continued without a pause. He was dying, very slowly and in great agony, but in some world remote from me where not even a bullet could damage him further. I felt that I had got to put an end to that dreadful noise. It seemed dreadful to see the great beast lying there, powerless to move and yet powerless to die, and not even to be able to finish him. I sent back for my small rifle and poured shot after shot into his heart and down his throat. They seemed to make no impression. The tortured gasps continued as steadily as the ticking of a clock.\r\nIn the end I could not stand it any longer and went away. I heard later that it took him half an hour to die. Burmans were bringing dahs and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon.\r\nAfterwards, of course, there were endless discussions about the shooting of the elephant. The owner was furious, but he was only an Indian and could do nothing. Besides, legally I had done the right thing, for a mad elephant has to be killed, like a mad dog, if its owner fails to control it. Among the Europeans opinion was divided. The older men said I was right, the younger men said it was a damn shame to shoot an elephant for killing a coolie, because an elephant was worth more than any damn Coringhee coolie. And afterwards I was very glad that the coolie had been killed; it put me legally in the right and it gave me a sufficient pretext for shooting the elephant. I often wondered whether any of the others grasped that I had done it solely to avoid looking a fool."}, {"name": "The Baron of Grogzwig", "author": "Charles Dickens", "genre": ["classics"], "text": "The Baron Von Ko\u00ebldwethout, of Grogzwig in Germany, was as likely a young baron as you would wish to see. I needn't say that he lived in a castle, because that's of course; neither need I say that he lived in an old castle; for what German baron ever lived in a new one? There were many strange circumstances connected with this venerable building, among which, not the least startling and mysterious were, that when the wind blew, it rumbled in the chimneys, or even howled among the trees in the neighboring forest; and that when the moon shone, she found her way through certain small loopholes in the wall, and actually made some parts of the wide halls and galleries quite light, while she left others in gloomy shadow. I believe that one of the baron's ancestors, being short of money, had inserted a dagger in a gentleman who called one night to ask his way, and it was supposed that these miraculous occurrences took place in consequence. And yet I hardly know how that could have been, either, because the baron's ancestor, who was an amiable man, felt very sorry afterwards for having been so rash, and laying violent hands upon a quantity of stone and timber which belonged to a weaker baron, built a chapel as an apology, and so took a receipt from Heaven, in full of all demands.\r\nTalking of the baron's ancestor puts me in mind of the baron's great claims to respect, on the score of his pedigree. I am afraid to say, I am sure, how many ancestors the baron had; but I know that he had a great many more than any other man of his time; and I only wish that he had lived in these latter days, that he might have had more. It is a very hard thing upon the great men of past centuries, that they should have come into the world so soon, because a man who was born three or four hundred years ago, cannot reasonably be expected to have had as many relations before him, as a man who is born now. The last man, whoever he is - and he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know - will have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive; and I contend that this is not fair.\r\nWell, but the Baron Von Ko\u00ebldwethout of Grogzwig! He was a fine swarthy fellow, with dark hair and large moustachios, who rode a-hunting in clothes of Lincoln green, with russet boots on his feet, and a bugle slung over his shoulder, like the guard of a long stage. When he blew this bugle, four-and-twenty other gentlemen of inferior rank, in Lincoln green a little coarser, and russet boots with a little thicker soles, turned out directly; and away galloped the whole train, with spears in their hands like lackered area railings, to hunt down the boars, or perhaps encounter a bear: in which latter case the baron killed him first, and greased his whiskers with him afterwards.\r\nThis was a merry life for the Baron of Grogzwig, and a merrier still for the baron's retainers, who drank Rhine wine every night till they fell under the table, and then had the bottles on the floor, and called for pipes. Never were such jolly, roystering, rollicking, merry-making blades, as the jovial crew of Grogzwig.\r\nBut the pleasures of the table, or the pleasures of under the table, require a little variety; especially when the same five-and-twenty people sit daily down to the same board, to discuss the same subjects, and tell the same stories. The baron grew weary, and wanted excitement. He took to quarrelling with his gentlemen, and tried kicking two or three of them every day after dinner. This was a pleasant change at first; but it became monotonous after a week or so, and the baron felt quite out of sorts, and cast about, in despair, for some new amusement.\r\nOne night, after a day's sport in which he had outdone Nimrod or Gillingwater, and slaughtered \"another fine bear\", and brought him home in triumph, the Baron Von Ko\u00ebldwethout sat moodily at the head of his table, eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect. He swallowed huge bumpers of wine, but the more he swallowed, the more he frowned. The gentlemen who had been honoured with the dangerous distinction of sitting on his right and left, imitated him to a miracle in the drinking, and frowned at each other.\r\n\"I will!\" cried the baron suddenly, smiting the table with his right hand, and twirling his moustache with his left. \"Fill to the Lady of Grogzwig!\"\r\nThe four-and-twenty Lincoln greens turned pale, with the exception of their four-and-twenty noses, which were unchangeable.\r\n\"I said to the Lady of Grogzwig,\" repeated the baron, looking round the board.\r\n\"To the Lady of Grogzwig!\" shouted the Lincoln greens; and down their four-and-twenty throats went four-and-twenty imperial pints of such rare old hock, that they smacked their eight-and-forty lips, and winked again.\r\n\"The fair daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen,\" said Ko\u00ebldwethout, condescending to explain. \"We will demand her in marriage of her father, ere the sun goes down tomorrow. If he refuse our suit, we will cut off his nose.\"\r\nA hoarse murmur arose from the company; every man touched, first the hilt of his sword, and then the tip of his nose, with appalling significance.\r\nWhat a pleasant thing filial piety is, to contemplate! If the daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart, or fallen at her father's feet and corned them in salt tears, or only fainted away, and complimented the old gentleman in frantic ejaculations, the odds are a hundred to one, but Swillenhausen castle would have been turned out at window, or rather the baron turned out at window, and the castle demolished. The damsel held her peace, however, when an early messenger bore the request of Von Ko\u00ebldwethout next morning, and modestly retired to her chamber, from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue. She was no sooner assured that the horseman with the large moustachios was her proferred husband, than she hastened to her father's presence, and expressed her readiness to sacrifice herself to secure his peace. The venerable baron caught his child into his arms, and shed a wink of joy.\r\nThere was a great feasting at the castle, that day. The four-and-twenty Lincoln greens of Von Ko\u00ebldwethout exchanged vows of eternal friendship with twelve Lincoln greens of Von Swillenhausen, and promised the old baron that they would drink his wine \"Till all was blue\" - meaning probably until their whole countenances had acquired the same tint as their noses. Everybody slapped everybody else's back, when the time for parting came; and the Baron Von Ko\u00ebldwethout and his followers rode gaily home.\r\nFor six mortal weeks, the bears and boars had a holiday. The houses of Ko\u00ebldwethout and Swillenhausen were united; the spears rusted; and the baron's bugle grew hoarse for lack of blowing.\r\nThose were great times for the four-and-twenty; but, alas! their high and palmy days had taken boots to themselves, and were already walking off.\r\n\"My dear,\" said the baroness.\r\n\"My love,\" said the baron.\r\n\"Those coarse, noisy men--\"\r\n\"Which, ma'am?\" said the baron starting.\r\nThe baroness pointed, from the window at which they stood, to the courtyard beneath, where the unconscious Lincoln greens were taking a copious stirrup-cup, preparatory to issuing forth, after a boar or two.\r\n\"My hunting train, ma'am,\" said the baron.\r\n\"Disband them, love,\" murmured the baroness.\r\n\"Disband them!\" cried the baron, in amazement.\r\n\"To please me, love,\" replied the baroness.\r\n\"To please the devil, ma'am,\" answered the baron.\r\nWhereupon the baroness uttered a great cry, and swooned away at the baron's feet.\r\nWhat could the baron do? He called for the lady's maid, and roared for the doctor; and then, rushing into the yard, kicked the two Lincoln greens who were the most used to it, and cursing the others all round, bade them go - but never mind where, I don't know the German for it, or I would put it delicately that way.\r\nIt is not for me to say by what means or by what degrees, some wives manage to keep down some husbands as they do, although I may have my private opinion on the subject, and may think that no Member of Parliament ought to be married, inasmuch as three married members out of every four, must vote according to their wives' consciences if there be such things, and not according to their own. All I need say, just now, is, that the Baroness Von Ko\u00ebldwethout somehow or other acquired great control over the Baron Von Ko\u00ebldwethout, and that, little by little, and bit by bit, and day by day, and year by year, the baron got the worst of some disputed question, or was slily unhorsed from some old hobby; and that by the time he was a fat hearty fellow of forty-eight or thereabouts, he had no feasting, no revelry, no hunting train, and no hunting - nothing in short that he liked, or used to have; and that, although he was as fierce as a lion and as bold as brass, he was decidedly snubbed and put down, by his own lady, in his own castle of Grogzwig.\r\nNor was this the whole extent of the baron's misfortunes. About a year after his nuptials, there came into the world a lusty young baron, in whose honour a great many fireworks were let off, and a great many dozens of wine drunk; but next year there came a young baroness, and next year another young baron, and so on, every year, either a baron or baroness and one year both together, until the baron found himself the father of a small family of twelve. Upon every one of these anniversaries, the venerable Baroness Von Swillenhausen was nervously sensitive for the well-being of her child the Baroness Von Ko\u00ebldwethout and although it was not found that the good lady ever did anything material towards contributing to her child's recovery, still she made it a point of duty to be as nervous as possible at the castle at Grogzwig, and to divide her time between moral observations on the baron's housekeeping, and bewailing the hard lot of her unhappy daughter. And if the Baron of Grogzwig, a little hurt and irritated at this, took heart, and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons, the Baroness Von Swillenhausen begged all persons to take notice, that nobody but she, sympathized with her dear daughter's sufferings; upon which, her relations and friends remarked, that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son-in-law, and that if there were a hard-hearted brute alive, it was that Baron of Grogzwig.\r\nThe poor baron bore it all, as long as he could, and when he could bear it no longer lost his appetite and his spirits, and sat himself gloomily and dejectedly down. But there were worse troubles yet in store for him, and as they came on, his melancholy and sadness increased. Times changed. He got into debt. The Grogzwig coffers ran low, though the Swillenhausen family had looked upon them as inexhaustible; and just when the baroness was on the point of making a thirteenth addition to the family pedigree, Von Ko\u00ebldwethout discovered that he had no means of replenishing them.\r\n\"I don't see what is to be done,\" said the baron. \"I think I'll kill myself.\"\r\nThis was a bright idea. The baron took an old hunting-knife from a cupboard hard by, and having sharpened it on his boot, made what boys call \"an offer\" at his throat.\r\n\"Hem!\" said the baron, stopping short. \"Perhaps it's not sharp enough.\"\r\nThe baron sharpened it again, and made another offer, when his hand was arrested by a loud screaming among the young barons and baronesses, who had a nursery in an upstairs tower with iron bars outside the window, to prevent their tumbling out into the moat.\r\n\"If I had been a bachelor,\" said the baron sighing, \"I might have done it fifty times over, without being interrupted. Hallo! Put a flask of wine and the largest pipe, in the little vaulted room behind the hall.\"\r\nOne of the domestics, in a very kind manner, executed the baron's order in the course of half an hour or so, and Von Ko\u00ebldwethout being apprised thereof, strode to the vaulted room, the walls of which, being of dark shining wood, gleamed in the light of the blazing logs which were piled upon the hearth. The bottle and pipe were ready, and, upon the whole, the place looked very comfortable.\r\n\"Leave the lamp,\" said the baron.\r\n\"Anything else, my lord?\" inquired the domestic.\r\n\"The room,\" replied the baron. The domestic obeyed, and the baron locked the door.\r\n\"I'll smoke a last pipe,\" said the baron, \"and then I'll be off.\" So, putting the knife upon the table till he wanted it, and tossing off a goodly measure of wine, the Lord of Grogzwig threw himself back in his chair, stretched his legs out before the fire, and puffed away.\r\nHe thought about a great many things - about his present troubles and past days of bachelorship, and about the Lincoln greens, long since disappeared up and down the country, no one knew whither: with the exception of two who had been unfortunately beheaded, and four who had killed themselves with drinking. His mind was running upon bears and boars, when, in the process of draining his glass to the bottom, he raised his eyes, and saw, for the first time and with unbounded astonishment, that he was not alone.\r\nNo, he was not; for, on the opposite side of the fire, there sat with folded arms a wrinkled hideous figure, with deeply sunk and bloodshot eyes, and an immensely long, cadaverous face, shadowed by jagged and matted locks of coarse black hair. He wore a kind of tunic of a dull bluish colour, which, the baron observed, on regarding it attentively, was clasped or ornamented down the front, with coffin handles. His legs too, were encased in coffin plates as though in armour; and over his left shoulder he wore a short dusky cloak, which seemed made of remnant of some pall. He took no notice of the baron, but was intently eyeing the fire.\r\n\"Halloa!\" said the baron, stamping his foot to attract attention.\r\n\"Halloa!\" replied the stranger, moving his eyes towards the baron, but not his face or himself. \"What now?\"\r\n\"What now?\" replied the baron, nothing daunted by his hollow voice and lustreless eyes, \"I should ask that question. How did you get here?\"\r\n\"Through the door,\" replied the figure.\r\n\"What are you?\" says the baron.\r\n\"A man,\" replied the figure.\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" says the baron.\r\n\"Disbelieve it then,\" says the figure.\r\n\"I will,\" rejoined the baron.\r\nThe figure looked at the bold Baron of Grogzwig for some time, and then said familiarly,\r\n\"There's no coming over you, I see. I'm not a man!\"\r\n\"What are you then?\" asked the baron.\r\n\"A genius,\" replied the figure.\r\n\"You don't look much like one,\" returned the baron scornfully.\r\n\"I am the Genius of Despair and Suicide,\" said the apparition. \"Now you know me.\"\r\nWith these words the apparition turned towards the baron, as if composing himself for a talk - and, what was very remarkable, was, that he threw his cloak aside, and displaying a stake, which was run through the centre of his body, pulled it out with a jerk, and laid it on the table, as composedly as if it had been a walking-stick.\r\n\"Now,\" said the figure, glancing at the hunting-knife, \"are you ready for me?\"\r\n\"Not quite,\" rejoined the baron; \"I must finish this pipe first.\"\r\n\"Look sharp then,\" said the figure.\r\nYou seem in a hurry,\" said the baron.\r\n\"Why, yes, I am,\" answered the figure; \"they're doing a pretty brisk business in my way, over in England and France just now, and my time is a good deal taken up.\"\r\n\"Do you drink?\" said the baron, touching the bottle with the bowl of his pipe.\r\n\"Nine times out of ten, and then very hard,\" rejoined the figure, drily.\r\n\"Never in moderation?\" asked the baron.\r\n\"Never,\" replied the figure, with a shudder, \"that breeds cheerfulness.\"\r\nThe baron took another look at his new friend, whom he thought an uncommonly queer customer, and at length inquired whether he took any active part in such little proceedings as that which he had in contemplation.\r\n\"No,\" replied the figure evasively; \"but I am always present.\"\r\n\"Just to see fair, I suppose?\" said the baron.\r\n\"Just that,\" replied the figure playing with the stake, and examining the ferule.\r\n\"Be as quick as you can, will you, for there's a young gentleman who is afflicted with too much money and leisure wanting me now, I find.\"\r\n\"Going to kill himself because he has too much money!\" exclaimed the baron, quite tickled: \"Ha! ha! that's a good one.\" This was the first time the baron had laughed for many a long day.\r\n\"I say,\" expostulated the figure, looking very much scared; \"don't do that again.\"\r\n\"Why not?\" demanded the baron.\r\n\"Because it gives me pain all over,\" replied the figure. \"Sigh as much as you please; that does me good.\"\r\nThe baron sighed mechanically, at the mention of the word; the figure, brightening up again, handed him the hunting-knife with the most winning politeness.\r\n\"It's not a bad idea though,\" said the baron, feeling the edge of the weapon; \"a man killing himself because he has too much money.\"\r\n\"Pooh!\" said the apparition, petulantly, \"no better than a man's killing himself because he has none or little.\"\r\nWhether the genius unintentionally committed himself in saying this, or whether he thought the baron's mind was so thoroughly made up that it didn't matter what he said, I have no means of knowing. I only know that the baron stopped his hand, all of a sudden, opened his eyes wide, and looked as if quite a new light had come upon him for the first time.\r\n\"Why, certainly,\" said Von Ko\u00ebldwethout, \"nothing is too bad to be retrieved.\"\r\n\"Except empty coffers,\" cried the genius.\r\n\"Well, but they may be one day filled again,\" said the baron.\r\n\"Scolding wives,\" snarled the genius.\r\n\"Oh! They may be made quiet,\" said the baron.\r\n\"Thirteen children,\" shouted the genius.\r\n\"Can't all go wrong, surely,\" said the baron.\r\nThe genius was evidently growing very savage with the baron, for holding these opinions all at once; but he tried to laugh it off, and said if he would let him know when he had left off joking, he should feel obliged to him.\r\n\"But I am not joking; I was never farther from it,\" remonstrated the baron.\r\n\"Well, I am glad to hear that,\" said the genius, looking very grim, \"because a joke, without any figure of speech, is the death of me. come! Quit this dreary world at once.\"\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the baron, playing with the knife; \"it's a dreary one certainly, but I don't think yours is much better, for you have not the appearance of being particularly comfortable. That puts me in mind - what security have I, that I shall be any the better for going out of the world after all!\" he cried, starting up; \"I never thought of that.\"\r\n\"Dispatch,\" cried the figure, gnashing its teeth.\r\n\"Keep off!\" said the baron, \"I'll brood over miseries no longer, but put a good face on the matter, and try the fresh air and the bears again; and if that don't do, I'll talk to the baroness soundly, and cut the Von Swillenhausens dead.\" With this the baron fell into his chair, and laughed so loud and boisterously, that the room rang with it.\r\nThe figure fell back a pace or two, regarding the baron meanwhile with a look of intense terror, and when he had ceased, caught up the stake, plunged it violently into its body, uttered a frightful howl, and disappeared.\r\nVon Ko\u00ebldwethout never saw it again. Having once made up his mind to action, he soon brought the baroness and the Von Swillenhausens to reason, and died many years afterwards; not a rich man that I am aware of, but certainly a happy one: leaving behind him a numerous family, who had been carefully educated in bear- and boar-hunting under his own personal eye. And my advice to all men is, that if ever they become hipped and melancholy from similar causes as very many men do, they look at both sides of the question, applying a magnifying glass to the best one; and if they still feel tempted to retire without leave, that they smoke a large pipe and drink a full bottle first, and profit by the laudable example of the baron of Grogzwig."}, {"name": "The Poor Relation's Story", "author": "Charles Dickens", "genre": ["classics"], "text": "He was very reluctant to take precedence of so many respected members of the family, by beginning the round of stories they were to relate as they sat in a goodly circle by the Christmas fire; and he modestly suggested that it would be more correct if \"John our esteemed host\" (whose health he begged to drink) would have the kindness to begin. For as to himself, he said, he was so little used to lead the way that really--But as they all cried out here, that he must begin, and agreed with one voice that he might, could, would, and should begin, he left off rubbing his hands, and took his legs out from under his armchair, and did begin.\r\nI have no doubt (said the poor relation) that I shall surprise the assembled members of our family, and particularly John our esteemed host to whom we are so much indebted for the great hospitality with which he has this day entertained us, by the confession I am going to make. But, if you do me the honour to be surprised at anything that falls from a person so unimportant in the family as I am, I can only say that I shall be scrupulously accurate in all I relate.\r\nI am not what I am supposed to be. I am quite another thing. Perhaps before I go further, I had better glance at what I AM supposed to be.\r\nIt is supposed, unless I mistake--the assembled members of our family will correct me if I do, which is very likely (here the poor relation looked mildly about him for contradiction); that I am nobody's enemy but my own. That I never met with any particular success in anything. That I failed in business because I was unbusiness-like and credulous--in not being prepared for the interested designs of my partner. That I failed in love, because I was ridiculously trustful--in thinking it impossible that Christiana could deceive me. That I failed in my expectations from my uncle Chill, on account of not being as sharp as he could have wished in worldly matters. That, through life, I have been rather put upon and disappointed in a general way. That I am at present a bachelor of between fifty-nine and sixty years of age, living on a limited income in the form of a quarterly allowance, to which I see that John our esteemed host wishes me to make no further allusion.\r\nThe supposition as to my present pursuits and habits is to the following effect.\r\nI live in a lodging in the Clapham Road--a very clean back room, in a very respectable house--where I am expected not to be at home in the day-time, unless poorly; and which I usually leave in the morning at nine o'clock, on pretence of going to business. I take my breakfast--my roll and butter, and my half-pint of coffee--at the old-established coffee-shop near Westminster Bridge; and then I go into the City--I don't know why--and sit in Garraway's Coffee House, and on 'Change, and walk about, and look into a few offices and counting-houses where some of my relations or acquaintance are so good as to tolerate me, and where I stand by the fire if the weather happens to be cold. I get through the day in this way until five o'clock, and then I dine: at a cost, on the average, of one and threepence. Having still a little money to spend on my evening's entertainment, I look into the old-established coffee-shop as I go home, and take my cup of tea, and perhaps my bit of toast. So, as the large hand of the clock makes its way round to the morning hour again, I make my way round to the Clapham Road again, and go to bed when I get to my lodging--fire being expensive, and being objected to by the family on account of its giving trouble and making a dirt.\r\nSometimes, one of my relations or acquaintances is so obliging as to ask me to dinner. Those are holiday occasions, and then I generally walk in the Park. I am a solitary man, and seldom walk with anybody. Not that I am avoided because I am shabby; for I am not at all shabby, having always a very good suit of black on (or rather Oxford mixture, which has the appearance of black and wears much better); but I have got into a habit of speaking low, and being rather silent, and my spirits are not high, and I am sensible that I am not an attractive companion.\r\nThe only exception to this general rule is the child of my first cousin, Little Frank. I have a particular affection for that child, and he takes very kindly to me. He is a diffident boy by nature; and in a crowd he is soon run over, as I may say, and forgotten. He and I, however, get on exceedingly well. I have a fancy that the poor child will in time succeed to my peculiar position in the family. We talk but little; still, we understand each other. We walk about, hand in hand; and without much speaking he knows what I mean, and I know what he means. When he was very little indeed, I used to take him to the windows of the toy-shops, and show him the toys inside. It is surprising how soon he found out that I would have made him a great many presents if I had been in circumstances to do it.\r\nLittle Frank and I go and look at the outside of the Monument--he is very fond of the Monument--and at the Bridges, and at all the sights that are free. On two of my birthdays, we have dined on e-la-mode beef, and gone at half-price to the play, and been deeply interested. I was once walking with him in Lombard Street, which we often visit on account of my having mentioned to him that there are great riches there--he is very fond of Lombard Street--when a gentleman said to me as he passed by, \"Sir, your little son has dropped his glove.\" I assure you, if you will excuse my remarking on so trivial a circumstance, this accidental mention of the child as mine, quite touched my heart and brought the foolish tears into my eyes.\r\nWhen Little Frank is sent to school in the country, I shall be very much at a loss what to do with myself, but I have the intention of walking down there once a month and seeing him on a half holiday. I am told he will then be at play upon the Heath; and if my visits should be objected to, as unsettling the child, I can see him from a distance without his seeing me, and walk back again. His mother comes of a highly genteel family, and rather disapproves, I am aware, of our being too much together. I know that I am not calculated to improve his retiring disposition; but I think he would miss me beyond the feeling of the moment if we were wholly separated.\r\nWhen I die in the Clapham Road, I shall not leave much more in this world than I shall take out of it; but, I happen to have a miniature of a bright-faced boy, with a curling head, and an open shirt-frill waving down his bosom (my mother had it taken for me, but I can't believe that it was ever like), which will be worth nothing to sell, and which I shall beg may he given to Frank. I have written my dear boy a little letter with it, in which I have told him that I felt very sorry to part from him, though bound to confess that I knew no reason why I should remain here. I have given him some short advice, the best in my power, to take warning of the consequences of being nobody's enemy but his own; and I have endeavoured to comfort him for what I fear he will consider a bereavement, by pointing out to him, that I was only a superfluous something to every one but him; and that having by some means failed to find a place in this great assembly, I am better out of it.\r\nSuch (said the poor relation, clearing his throat and beginning to speak a little louder) is the general impression about me. Now, it is a remarkable circumstance which forms the aim and purpose of my story, that this is all wrong. This is not my life, and these are not my habits. I do not even live in the Clapham Road. Comparatively speaking, I am very seldom there. I reside, mostly, in a--I am almost ashamed to say the word, it sounds so full of pretension--in a Castle. I do not mean that it is an old baronial habitation, but still it is a building always known to every one by the name of a Castle. In it, I preserve the particulars of my history; they run thus:\r\nIt was when I first took John Spatter (who had been my clerk) into partnership, and when I was still a young man of not more than five- and-twenty, residing in the house of my uncle Chill, from whom I had considerable expectations, that I ventured to propose to Christiana. I had loved Christiana a long time. She was very beautiful, and very winning in all respects. I rather mistrusted her widowed mother, who I feared was of a plotting and mercenary turn of mind; but, I thought as well of her as I could, for Christiana's sake. I never had loved any one but Christiana, and she had been all the world, and far more than all the world, to me, from our childhood!\r\nChristiana accepted me with her mother's consent, and I was rendered very happy indeed. My life at my uncle Chill's was of a spare dull kind, and my garret chamber was as dull, and bare, and cold, as an upper prison room in some stern northern fortress. But, having Christiana's love, I wanted nothing upon earth. I would not have changed my lot with any human being.\r\nAvarice was, unhappily, my uncle Chill's master-vice. Though he was rich, he pinched, and scraped, and clutched, and lived miserably. As Christiana had no fortune, I was for some time a little fearful of confessing our engagement to him; but, at length I wrote him a letter, saying how it all truly was. I put it into his hand one night, on going to bed.\r\nAs I came down-stairs next morning, shivering in the cold December air; colder in my uncle's unwarmed house than in the street, where the winter sun did sometimes shine, and which was at all events enlivened by cheerful faces and voices passing along; I carried a heavy heart towards the long, low breakfast-room in which my uncle sat. It was a large room with a small fire, and there was a great bay window in it which the rain had marked in the night as if with the tears of houseless people. It stared upon a raw yard, with a cracked stone pavement, and some rusted iron railings half uprooted, whence an ugly out-building that had once been a dissecting-room (in the time of the great surgeon who had mortgaged the house to my uncle), stared at it.\r\nWe rose so early always, that at that time of the year we breakfasted by candle-light. When I went into the room, my uncle was so contracted by the cold, and so huddled together in his chair behind the one dim candle, that I did not see him until I was close to the table.\r\nAs I held out my hand to him, he caught up his stick (being infirm, he always walked about the house with a stick), and made a blow at me, and said, \"You fool!\"\r\n\"Uncle,\" I returned, \"I didn't expect you to be so angry as this.\" Nor had I expected it, though he was a hard and angry old man.\r\n\"You didn't expect!\" said he; \"when did you ever expect? When did you ever calculate, or look forward, you contemptible dog?\"\r\n\"These are hard words, uncle!\"\r\n\"Hard words? Feathers, to pelt such an idiot as you with,\" said he. \"Here! Betsy Snap! Look at him!\"\r\nBetsy Snap was a withered, hard-favoured, yellow old woman--our only domestic--always employed, at this time of the morning, in rubbing my uncle's legs. As my uncle adjured her to look at me, he put his lean grip on the crown of her head, she kneeling beside him, and turned her face towards me. An involuntary thought connecting them both with the Dissecting Room, as it must often have been in the surgeon's time, passed across my mind in the midst of my anxiety.\r\n\"Look at the snivelling milksop!\" said my uncle. \"Look at the baby! This is the gentleman who, people say, is nobody's enemy but his own. This is the gentleman who can't say no. This is the gentleman who was making such large profits in his business that he must needs take a partner, t'other day. This is the gentleman who is going to marry a wife without a penny, and who falls into the hands of Jezabels who are speculating on my death!\"\r\nI knew, now, how great my uncle's rage was; for nothing short of his being almost beside himself would have induced him to utter that concluding word, which he held in such repugnance that it was never spoken or hinted at before him on any account.\r\n\"On my death,\" he repeated, as if he were defying me by defying his own abhorrence of the word. \"On my death--death--Death! But I'll spoil the speculation. Eat your last under this roof, you feeble wretch, and may it choke you!\"\r\nYou may suppose that I had not much appetite for the breakfast to which I was bidden in these terms; but, I took my accustomed seat. I saw that I was repudiated henceforth by my uncle; still I could bear that very well, possessing Christiana's heart.\r\nHe emptied his basin of bread and milk as usual, only that he took it on his knees with his chair turned away from the table where I sat. When he had done, he carefully snuffed out the candle; and the cold, slate-coloured, miserable day looked in upon us.\r\n\"Now, Mr. Michael,\" said he, \"before we part, I should like to have a word with these ladies in your presence.\"\r\n\"As you will, sir,\" I returned; \"but you deceive yourself, and wrong us, cruelly, if you suppose that there is any feeling at stake in this contract but pure, disinterested, faithful love.\"\r\nTo this, he only replied, \"You lie!\" and not one other word.\r\nWe went, through half-thawed snow and half-frozen rain, to the house where Christiana and her mother lived. My uncle knew them very well. They were sitting at their breakfast, and were surprised to see us at that hour.\r\n\"Your servant, ma'am,\" said my uncle to the mother. \"You divine the purpose of my visit, I dare say, ma'am. I understand there is a world of pure, disinterested, faithful love cooped up here. I am happy to bring it all it wants, to make it complete. I bring you your son-in-law, ma'am--and you, your husband, miss. The gentleman is a perfect stranger to me, but I wish him joy of his wise bargain.\"\r\nHe snarled at me as he went out, and I never saw him again.\r\nIt is altogether a mistake (continued the poor relation) to suppose that my dear Christiana, over-persuaded and influenced by her mother, married a rich man, the dirt from whose carriage wheels is often, in these changed times, thrown upon me as she rides by. No, no. She married me.\r\nThe way we came to be married rather sooner than we intended, was this. I took a frugal lodging and was saving and planning for her sake, when, one day, she spoke to me with great earnestness, and said:\r\n\"My dear Michael, I have given you my heart. I have said that I loved you, and I have pledged myself to be your wife. I am as much yours through all changes of good and evil as if we had been married on the day when such words passed between us. I know you well, and know that if we should be separated and our union broken off, your whole life would be shadowed, and all that might, even now, be stronger in your character for the conflict with the world would then be weakened to the shadow of what it is!\"\r\n\"God help me, Christiana!\" said I. \"You speak the truth.\"\r\n\"Michael!\" said she, putting her hand in mine, in all maidenly devotion, \"let us keep apart no longer. It is but for me to say that I can live contented upon such means as you have, and I well know you are happy. I say so from my heart. Strive no more alone; let us strive together. My dear Michael, it is not right that I should keep secret from you what you do not suspect, but what distresses my whole life. My mother: without considering that what you have lost, you have lost for me, and on the assurance of my faith: sets her heart on riches, and urges another suit upon me, to my misery. I cannot bear this, for to bear it is to be untrue to you. I would rather share your struggles than look on. I want no better home than you can give me. I know that you will aspire and labour with a higher courage if I am wholly yours, and let it be so when you will!\"\r\nI was blest indeed, that day, and a new world opened to me. We were married in a very little while, and I took my wife to our happy home. That was the beginning of the residence I have spoken of; the Castle we have ever since inhabited together, dates from that time. All our children have been born in it. Our first child--now married--was a little girl, whom we called Christiana. Her son is so like Little Frank, that I hardly know which is which.\r\nThe current impression as to my partner's dealings with me is also quite erroneous. He did not begin to treat me coldly, as a poor simpleton, when my uncle and I so fatally quarrelled; nor did he afterwards gradually possess himself of our business and edge me out. On the contrary, he behaved to me with the utmost good faith and honour.\r\nMatters between us took this turn:- On the day of my separation from my uncle, and even before the arrival at our counting-house of my trunks (which he sent after me, NOT carriage paid), I went down to our room of business, on our little wharf, overlooking the river; and there I told John Spatter what had happened. John did not say, in reply, that rich old relatives were palpable facts, and that love and sentiment were moonshine and fiction. He addressed me thus:\r\n\"Michael,\" said John, \"we were at school together, and I generally had the knack of getting on better than you, and making a higher reputation.\"\r\n\"You had, John,\" I returned.\r\n\"Although\" said John, \"I borrowed your books and lost them; borrowed your pocket-money, and never repaid it; got you to buy my damaged knives at a higher price than I had given for them new; and to own to the windows that I had broken.\"\r\n\"All not worth mentioning, John Spatter,\" said I, \"but certainly true.\"\r\n\"When you were first established in this infant business, which promises to thrive so well,\" pursued John, \"I came to you, in my search for almost any employment, and you made me your clerk.\"\r\n\"Still not worth mentioning, my dear John Spatter,\" said I; \"still, equally true.\"\r\n\"And finding that I had a good head for business, and that I was really useful to the business, you did not like to retain me in that capacity, and thought it an act of justice soon to make me your partner.\"\r\n\"Still less worth mentioning than any of those other little circumstances you have recalled, John Spatter,\" said I; \"for I was, and am, sensible of your merits and my deficiencies.\"\r\n\"Now, my good friend,\" said John, drawing my arm through his, as he had had a habit of doing at school; while two vessels outside the windows of our counting-house--which were shaped like the stern windows of a ship--went lightly down the river with the tide, as John and I might then be sailing away in company, and in trust and confidence, on our voyage of life; \"let there, under these friendly circumstances, be a right understanding between us. You are too easy, Michael. You are nobody's enemy but your own. If I were to give you that damaging character among our connexion, with a shrug, and a shake of the head, and a sigh; and if I were further to abuse the trust you place in me--\"\r\n\"But you never will abuse it at all, John,\" I observed.\r\n\"Never!\" said he; \"but I am putting a case--I say, and if I were further to abuse that trust by keeping this piece of our common affairs in the dark, and this other piece in the light, and again this other piece in the twilight, and so on, I should strengthen my strength, and weaken your weakness, day by day, until at last I found myself on the high road to fortune, and you left behind on some bare common, a hopeless number of miles out of the way.\"\r\n\"Exactly so,\" said I.\r\n\"To prevent this, Michael,\" said John Spatter, \"or the remotest chance of this, there must be perfect openness between us. Nothing must be concealed, and we must have but one interest.\"\r\n\"My dear John Spatter,\" I assured him, \"that is precisely what I mean.\"\r\n\"And when you are too easy,\" pursued John, his face glowing with friendship, \"you must allow me to prevent that imperfection in your nature from being taken advantage of, by any one; you must not expect me to humour it--\"\r\n\"My dear John Spatter,\" I interrupted, \"I DON'T expect you to humour it. I want to correct it.\"\r\n\"And I, too,\" said John.\r\n\"Exactly so!\" cried I. \"We both have the same end in view; and, honourably seeking it, and fully trusting one another, and having but one interest, ours will be a prosperous and happy partnership.\"\r\n\"I am sure of it!\" returned John Spatter. And we shook hands most affectionately.\r\nI took John home to my Castle, and we had a very happy day. Our partnership throve well. My friend and partner supplied what I wanted, as I had foreseen that he would, and by improving both the business and myself, amply acknowledged any little rise in life to which I had helped him.\r\nI am not (said the poor relation, looking at the fire as he slowly rubbed his hands) very rich, for I never cared to be that; but I have enough, and am above all moderate wants and anxieties. My Castle is not a splendid place, but it is very comfortable, and it has a warm and cheerful air, and is quite a picture of Home.\r\nOur eldest girl, who is very like her mother, married John Spatter's eldest son. Our two families are closely united in other ties of attachment. It is very pleasant of an evening, when we are all assembled together--which frequently happens--and when John and I talk over old times, and the one interest there has always been between us.\r\nI really do not know, in my Castle, what loneliness is. Some of our children or grandchildren are always about it, and the young voices of my descendants are delightful--O, how delightful!--to me to hear. My dearest and most devoted wife, ever faithful, ever loving, ever helpful and sustaining and consoling, is the priceless blessing of my house; from whom all its other blessings spring. We are rather a musical family, and when Christiana sees me, at any time, a little weary or depressed, she steals to the piano and sings a gentle air she used to sing when we were first betrothed. So weak a man am I, that I cannot bear to hear it from any other source. They played it once, at the Theatre, when I was there with Little Frank; and the child said wondering, \"Cousin Michael, whose hot tears are these that have fallen on my hand!\"\r\nSuch is my Castle, and such are the real particulars of my life therein preserved. I often take Little Frank home there. He is very welcome to my grandchildren, and they play together. At this time of the year--the Christmas and New Year time--I am seldom out of my Castle. For, the associations of the season seem to hold me there, and the precepts of the season seem to teach me that it is well to be there.\r\n\"And the Castle is--\" observed a grave, kind voice among the company.\r\n\"Yes. My Castle,\" said the poor relation, shaking his head as he still looked at the fire, \"is in the Air. John our esteemed host suggests its situation accurately. My Castle is in the Air! I have done. Will you be so good as to pass the story?\""}, {"name": "Cinderella", "author": "Agnes Taylor Ketchum & Ida M. Jorgensen", "genre": ["other"], "text": "Once upon a time the wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she knew her end was approaching she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said, \"Dear child, when I am gone, continue good and pious, and God will help you in every trouble and always care for you.\"\r\nSoon after this the mother closed her eyes in death, and the dear little maiden was left to weep for a mother's loving care, but she never forgot her last words, and tried to do all she could to make her papa happy.\r\nTime passed on, till one fine day in the Spring her father brought home another wife, who had two daughters. These two daughters were very fair and beautiful to look upon, but at heart they were evil-minded and malicious, and as soon as they saw the sweet, opened-faced little girl, with such sparkling blue eyes, and dimpled face surrounded by glossy curls, they began to hate her; so they persuaded their mother to banish her from the parlor to the kitchen. Here the poor child had a sad life of it. She was compelled to do the household drudgery, and wait on her beautiful step-sisters, and when work was done her only place was the chimney-corner bench, with no company except the old cat. And although she had once a pretty name, from sitting in the ashes and getting covered with cinders, they called her \"Cinderella.\"\r\nYears went on, and Cinderella bloomed like a wild rose, in spite of all her kitchen work and common dingy clothes.\r\nOne day a beautiful sweet-scented note came to the house from the King. He was going to give his son a fine ball, in honor of his twenty first birthday, and all the ladies in the land must come. How poor Cinderella longed to attend this ball! But when she asked to go, the stepmother and daughter laughed at her, and said she would be a beautiful sight at the King's ball, with her smutty face and ugly clothes. She was made to wash and iron, plait and crimp ruffles, and run errands, early and late, that the two daughters might look beautiful; at last when the night came, she helped to paint their faces, lace their satin shoes, and trim them up with flowers and laces. Then she watched the coach roll grandly out of sight, and after that returned to the kitchen and sat down in the cinders with the cat, and sobbed as if her heart would break. The poor old cat tried to comfort her (as she had often tried to do before) by rubbing her sides against poor Cinderella's ashy dress, and purring softly to her, but the poor child was too sad to notice her. The hot tears rolled down her cheeks and dropped into the grimy soot, when right before her, she knew not how or why, stood the oddest little old woman; her face was almost hid by a queer little bonnet that stood up iin a queer little peak in the back; her little short, thick body was covered with a long green cloak, and she leaned on a stout cane.\r\nAs Cinderella looked up, the good Fairy, for such she proved to be said: \"Why do you cry?\"\r\n\"It is so very lonely here,\" Cinderella said, and sobbed again.\r\nThe good Fairy patted her on the head, and whispered, \"Is that all? Wouldn't my dear Cinderella like to go to the ball? Dry up your tears, and run to the garden, quick, and bring me the largest, finest, yellow pumpkin you can find; then from the mouse-trap on the pantry shelf get six slick mice; tow fine rats you will find in the stable in the rat-trap; and from the watering-pot, or from under the garden stone, six green lizards must be brought!\"\r\nNimble as a cricket in the grass, Cinderella dried her tears, and ran and did as she was bid. And then the strangest thing of all happened! The good Fairy took her wand, which was hidden under her long cloak, and touched them every one.\r\nThe pumpkin changed into a coach, and the mice became six horses with harnesses of gold. One rat was a coachman, with jeweled livery, and the other rat became a herald, to blow a trumpet in advance, and the first blast that he sounded made the horses plunge and prance.\r\nThe lizards were made footmen, because they were so gay and spry, and Cinderella's dingy dress became a glistening gold brocade, and the gems that shone upon her fingers nothing could surpass, while on her feet were dainty little slippers made of glass. Then into the coach she quickly sprang.\r\n\"Be sure you are home by twelve o'clock,\" the good Fairy said, and then the footman quickly closed the coach door, and away the coach sped and was soon out of sight, and in a twinkling drew up before the King's palace.\r\nWhen Cinderella entered the ball-room, all eyes were turned upon her, as so beautiful a creature was never seen before. The Prince was so charmed with her, he claimed her for the dance, took her into super, and in every way showed his admiration, but Cinderella remembered the good Fairy's warning, and just at half-past eleven left the ball and hastened home.\r\nThe Prince inquired of every one who the lovely maiden was, without success, so the next night the King gave another ball, in hopes his son might be able to find out the home of Cinderella.\r\nAgain poor Cinderella helped her sisters primp and curl, and again the good Fairy came, and with her wand arrayed her in greater splendor than before. A crowd had gathered around the King's palace, as the lovely coach with its six prancing horses and lively footmen drove up, and as the lovely maiden sprang up the steps her slipper twinkled like stars.\r\nAgain the Prince was all attention, and chose only her for waltz or tete-a-tete, and the moments flew quickly; she did not dream of it being so late, until she heard the bell begin to strike, then she remembered what the good Fairy had said, and quickly as a swallow's flight she fled; but alas! in her hurry she dropped one tiny slipper on the steps. When she reaches the street she was just in time to see her coach changed into a pumpkin, and her six horses changed to mice, and her beautiful brocade changed into her cinder dress. The Prince had followed her to the door, hoping to see which way she went, but he only saw a poor little dirty girl, all covered with cinders, walking down the street. He found the glass slipper, and made the proclamation that the country should be searched, and any lady who could wear the slipper should come to the palace to live. So everybody tried it, until they came to cinderella's home. Then such pinching and squeezing as the two sister did trying to put on the slipper! But, no, it would not go on.\r\n\"Have you no other ladies in the house?\" the royal heralds asked.\r\n\"Oh, nobody but ugly Cinderella in the kitchen!\" the sister's replied.\r\n\"Well, she must try, as our orders are to miss no one,\" they said; and from the kitchen Cinderella stepped, and seating herself on a low stool she slipped the slipper on with ease, and from her pocket took its mate. Then the sisters cried, and stormed, and scolded in anger, while the courtier, without thinking, laughed from behind his hat, for here was all the evidence the Prince had asked complete, the two little slippers made of glass an exact fit for the two little feet.\r\nWhen the courtiers took the news home to the King and Prince, and told them where they had found the little beauty, there was great excitement at the court.\r\nSoon after this, Cinderella was brought to the King's palace, and given lovely clothes, such as only princesses wear, and was ever loved and petted for her goodness."}, {"name": "Little Red Riding Hood", "author": null, "genre": ["other"], "text": "Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else, so she was always called \"Little Red-Cap.\"\r\nOne day her mother said to her, \"Come little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, 'Good-morning,' and don't peep into every corner before you do it.\"\r\n\"I will take great care,\" said little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\r\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\r\n\"Good-day, little Red-Cap,\" said he.\r\n\"Thank you kindly, wolf.\"\r\n\"Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?\"\r\n\"To my grandmother's.\"\r\n\"What have you in your basket?\"\r\n\"Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\"\r\n\"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?\"\r\n\"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; the house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut trees are just below; you surely must know it,\" replied Little Red-Cap.\r\nThe wolf thought to himself, \"What a tender young creature? What a nice plump mouthful; she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\" So walking for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, he said, \"See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here\u2014why do you not look round? I believe too, you do not hear how sweetly the birds are singing, you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while every thing else out here in the wood is merry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, \"Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay, that would please her too. It is so early in the day, that I shall still get there in good time; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever site had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\r\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house, and knocked at the door.\r\n\"Who is there?\"\r\n\"Little Red-Cap,\" replied the wolf. \"She is, bringing cake and wine; open the door.\"\r\n\"Lift the latch and walk in,\" called the grandmother, \"I am too weak, and cannot get up.\"\r\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word, he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured har. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed, and drew the curtains.\r\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on her way to her.\r\nShe was surprised to find the cottage door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, \"Oh dear! how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\" She called out \"Good-morning,\" but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled over her face, and looking very strange.\r\n\"Oh! grandmother,\" She said, \"what big ears you have!\"\r\n\"The better to hear you with my child,\" was the reply.\r\n\"But grandmother, what big eyes you have ! \" she said.\r\n\"The better to see you with, any dear.\"\r\n\"But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\"\r\n\"The better to hug you with.\"\r\n\"Oh ! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\"\r\n\"The better to eat you with!\"\r\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound, he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\r\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.\r\nThe huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, \"How the old woman is snoring; I must just see if she wants anything.\" So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying on it. \"Do I find thee here, thou old sinner!\" said he. \"I have long sought thee!\" Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she still might be saved, so he did not fire but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out crying, \"Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf;\" and after that the aged grandmother came out also, but scarcely able to breathe.\r\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake, and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to her self, \"As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\""}, {"name": "The Raven", "author": "Edgar Allen Poe", "genre": ["horror"], "text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\r\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\r\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\r\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door -\r\nOnly this, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\r\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\nEagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow\r\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -\r\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -\r\nNameless here for evermore.\r\n\r\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\nThrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\r\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -\r\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -\r\nThis it is, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\r\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you \" - here I opened wide the door; -\r\nDarkness there and nothing more.\r\n\r\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\r\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\r\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\r\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\r\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\" -\r\nMerely this, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\nSoon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.\r\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\r\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -\r\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-\r\n'Tis the wind and nothing more!\"\r\n\r\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\nIn there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\r\nNot the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\r\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -\r\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -\r\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\r\nGhastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore -\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\r\nQuoth the raven \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\nThough its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;\r\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -\r\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\nWith such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nBut the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\r\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\nNothing farther then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -\r\nTill I scarcely more than muttered \"Other friends have flown before -\r\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\r\nThen the bird said \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store\r\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -\r\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\nOf \"Never - nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nBut the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\r\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -\r\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\nMeant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\r\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,\r\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,\r\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\nThen, me-thought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nSwung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he hath sent\r\nthee\r\n\r\nRespite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\r\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\r\nQuoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -\r\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -\r\nOn this home by Horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -\r\nIs there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!\"\r\nQuoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil - prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\nBy that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -\r\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\r\nQuoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, up-starting -\r\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\r\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\nLeave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!\r\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\nQuoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\r\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\n\r\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n\r\nShall be lifted - nevermore!"}]
